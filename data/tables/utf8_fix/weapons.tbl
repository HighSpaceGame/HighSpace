;  weapons.tbl
;
;  file to specify the weapon characteristics for Freespace weapons
;
;  weapons fall into three categories -- see weapon.doc in the
;  freespace Specs folder for more information.

; Real FreeSpace weapons!
; From weapons.doc, Adam's spec.
; · Light Laser Cannon: Much like Descent lasers.  Less powerful than Heavies.
; · Heavy Laser Cannon: Self-explanatory.  Fires slightly slower.
; · Mass Driver Cannon: Fires shells of some sort, but oddly uses energy, since its a cannon.
; · Flail Cannon: Rapid-fire energy-based weapon.  Shoots many smaller, rapid lasers.
; · Neutron Flux Cannon: Similar to Heavy Lasers, but more punch.  Could use a better name here.
;
; --------------------
; Ordering of entries:
; --------------------
;
; All primary weapons are listed in the first section, followed by secondary weapons in the next.
; Within each of these 2 sections, normal weapons should be listed first, followed by weapons
; that are only allowed on big ships, and following that, weapons that aren't allowed on any ships.
;
; -------------------------------
; A note regarding weapon sounds:
; -------------------------------
;       The index corresponds to the sounds.tbl index.  If you want a new weapon sound, you must first
;       add it to sounds.tbl.  If you don't want to assign a sound, put -1 as the index.
;
; ---------------
; Missile damage:
; ---------------
; The following fields determine the missile damage:
;       $Damage:                The damage applied within the inner radius of the blast
;       $Inner Radius:          The radius at which damage is 100% of $Damage field
;                                                       (0 for impact only)
;       $Outer Radius:          The radius at which damage is applied.  $Damage decreases
;                                                       linearly from $Inner Radius to $Outer Radius
;       $Shockwave Speed:       The speed of the shockwave (0 for no shockwave)
;
; ---------------
; Interface Art:
; ---------------
;
; $Icon:        filename that holds icon frames used in weapons selection
; $Anim: filename that holds weapon animation used in weapons selection
; 
; ---------------
; Misc
; ----------------
; $Impact Explosion:    Filename of animation to play when weapon impacts
; $Impact Explosion Radius:  How big the explosion is. Required if Impact Explosion is not none

"The GTM-4a Tornado is an upgrade to the Hornet missile. With improved fire control systems and guidance computers, the Tornado can be fired more rapidly and with greater accuracy than the Hornet. Though physically smaller than its predecessor, the Tornado launcher fires more rockets per volley, delivering a more devastating punch. Be advised that a Tornado missile will fail to arm its payload properly if aspect lock has not been achieved before firing.", 3340)

; Chaff (or whatever) pieces are projected backward in a hemisphere.
; JAS, 1/29/98, added a model name for how it renders.
