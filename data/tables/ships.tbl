;  file to indicate all ship types and their physical characteristics (such as physics info, etc)
;  format is a simple form of the mission files
;
;  Some general comments about some of the fields
;
;  Velocities are specified in (freespace) units/second.  You can currently only
;  specify velocities in the linear directions.  Rotational velocities are still
;  currently speified with thrust (until I get this fixed).  Rotation time is the
;  amount of time (in seconds) to complete 1 revolution in the given direction
;  (x is pitch, y is heading, and z is bank).
;
;  Damp affects how quickly you will accel/decel to your target velocity.  Higher damp
;  means slow acceleration and deceleration.  The lower this number, the faster
;  the ship responds.   For example, specifying a value of 0.0 means there is no
;  damping, in other words, people would say, "this has no physics, like Wing
;  Commander."   The more damping, the harder to control, but the more smoothly
;  it moves.
;
;  Accelerations:
;   All the acceleration numbers are damp factors for how fast the thing
;   changes speed.   0 would mean instantaneous velocity changes, and the
;   bigger the number, the slower the acceleration.  Sort of backwards, but...
;   forward_accel - The damp factor for when the ship is trying to go faster
;   forward_decel - The damp factor for when the ship is trying to slow down
;   slide_accel - The damp factor for left/right/up/down/reverse acceleration.
;   slide_decel - The damp factor for left/right/up/down/reverse deceleration.
;
;       Energy Transfer System:
;       $Power Output           =>      energy is produced per second by the ship's reactor
;		$Max Oclk Speed         =>      the max forward speed of the ship when 100% energy
;                                       is directed at the engines
;		$Max Weapon Eng         =>      how much weapon energy can be stored (related to $Energy Cosumed
;                                       field in weapons.tbl)
;
;       Afterburners:
;        $Afterburner                   => YES if afterburner present, NO otherwise
;
;        The following parameters must be present if $Afterburner is YES, otherwise comment
;   out or delete them:
;
;       +Aburn Max Vel:                 => x,y,z velocity when afterburner engaged
;       +Aburn For accel:               => forward accel when afterburner engaged
;       +Aburn Fuel:                    => fuel capacity of afterburners
;       +Aburn Burn Rate:               => rate in fuel/second that afterburners consume fuel
;       +Aburn Rec Rate:                => rate in fuel/second that afterburners recover fuel

XSTR("Affectionately nicknamed 'The Bat' by its pilots, the GTF Ulysses is a well-designed craft that has had a far longer useful life than its engineers ever imagined. Developed jointly by Terran and Vasudan contractors, the Ulysses was first deployed near the end of the Great War. Its excellent maneuverability and high top speed give it an agility that pilots love, but at a cost of thin armor and a small secondary weapon loadout. The Ulysses is a better choice for offensive missions than defensive ones.", 2944)

XSTR("The GTF Ares class of fighters is a radical upgrade of the Hercules II fighter. The power plant has been completely replaced with the newer, more powerful Nankam NA-27f model. Depleted uranium shielding has been added atop critical subsystems, making the Ares harder to incapacitate. Two primary weapon banks have been added, for greater firepower than the Herc II. This greater punch and protection come at a cost, however, as the Ares handles like a potato.", 2962)

Slated to replace the aging Valkyrie as the Alliance's primary interceptor, the Perseus's high max speed and maneuverability make it ideal to hunt and destroy enemy bombers. Perseus fighters have been assigned to the 3rd Battle Group on a trial basis, with wide deployment expected after the OpEval period. Primary weapons include the Subach HL-7 and Prometheus cannon, with secondary loads of Harpoon and Hornet missiles. Preliminary results have shown the Perseus to be a superb fighter.", 2986)

+Tech Description:
XSTR("The GTB Artemis is the most agile bomber in the GTVA fleet, which makes it ideal for quick-hitting missions against warships and other slow targets. Of the same technological generation as the Boanerges class, the Artemis is less heavily armed and carries a lighter weapon payload, but it is significantly more maneuverable. While the Boanerges can inflict more damage, the Artemis can undertake (and return from) missions the slower Boanerges would have no hope of surviving. All Artemis-class bombers in the GVTA fleet are currently serving with the 2nd and 3rd Battle Groups.", 3004)

XSTR("The GTB Artemis D.H. is an experimental variant of the standard Artemis class. The most notable change is that the Artemis's factory-issued Han-Ronald engines have been replaced by the same Nankam NA-27f powerplant now found in the GTF Ares fightercraft. The D.H. variant is faster and more maneuverable than the standard Artemis bomber, at no cost to armor or armament. During the OpEval period, Artemis D.H. bombers are being deployed in only select squadrons in different theatres of the war. If the evaluation trials go well, wider deployment of the Artemis D.H. class is expected.", 3010)

Ursas have the highest shielding of any bomber, along with a GTVI-designed hyper-dense hull.

The challenge of maintaining an aging fleet has motivated the GTVA to develop a new generation of ships able to withstand long-term abuse in the field. By maximizing shielding and payload (while offering enough maneuverability to make it a viable tactical unit), the Boanerges promises to remain in service for decades to come. One test pilot observed that the Boanerges handles better than any other bomber and has enough firepower to make it a formidable anti-capship weapon.", 3034)

XSTR("The GTSC Faustus is primarily a class of civilian research vessels. During times of peace, they serve as mobile laboratories for scientists in many disciplines. During wartime, however, Faustus vessels are commandeered by the military, mostly for weapons research. It was on a Faustus ship, during the Great War, that Shivan shield technology was first reverse-engineered from a captured Shivan fighter. Faustus vessels have poor armor and only a few weak turrets for defense. Only desperate circumstances find a Faustus anywhere near the front lines.", 3048)

+Tech Description:
XSTR("The GTD Hades was a fusion of Terran and Shivan military technologies. It was constructed by Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), a rogue branch of the GTA. In 2335, GTI leaders sought to overthrow the provisional GTA government established in Delta Serpentis. After the defeat of the GTI and the destruction of the Hades, the GTA classified the details of this research at level Omega. There are rumors that the Alliance has attempted to reconstruct the Hades to learn more about the GTI's activities. These reports have yet to be confirmed by government sources.", 3053)

+Tech Description:
XSTR("The GTVA Colossus resulted from an endeavor unprecedented in Terran or Vasudan history. This 6-kilometer-long behemoth is the result of 20 years of joint effort from dozens of contractors of both races. The Colossus is the most powerful space-faring warship ever made, bristling with over 80 weapon turrets. It also houses 60 fighter and bomber wings and requires a crew of over 30,000. The firepower of the Colossus is greater than that of most GTVA battle groups.", 3055)

$Species:                       Terran
+Tech Description:
XSTR("Deimos-class corvettes, such as the GTCv Actium and the GTCv Lysander, are the newest addition to the Terran fleet. These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class. As the Leviathan and Fenris cruisers of the Great War are gradually phased out, these corvettes will become the foundation of tomorrow's fleet.", 3056)

XSTR("The GTC Aeolus is the first cruiser class ever produced by the RNI shipyards orbiting Laramis II. Only two dozen of these cruisers were put into service in GTVA fleets, with production ending in 2365. Allied Command assigns Aeolus-class ships primarily to guard slow-moving convoys against fighter and bomber wings, as these cruisers are severely out-gunned by most capital ships in service today. Their flak and AAA turrets serve as marvelous deterrents to smaller craft, however.", 3057)

"Fast and highly maneuverable, the GVF Serapis is primarily used as a bomber interceptor. Its thin armor and weak shields give it a low survival rate in dogfights against more heavily armored fighters. Despite having only two primary and secondary weapon banks, the Serapis has been retrofitted to accommodate almost any loadout in the GTVA arsenal. Veteran Vasudan pilots love the Serapis for its agility and loadout options. Some Terran pilots who've been privileged enough to fly it claim to prefer it to any Terran fighter.", 3092)

"The GVF Tauret is replacing the Seth as the Vasudans' heavy assault fighter. While integrating cutting-edge technology developed in collaboration with the Terrans, the Tauret boasts a distinctly Vasudan design. Its unusual configuration was inspired by the Apsu-Hek, a creature that once inhabited the deserts of Vasuda Prime. The Apsu-Hek has become an emblem of the Vasudan diaspora, and the Tauret continues the tradition of symbolic design.

"Learning a lesson from the bomber losses of the Great War, Vasudan defense contractor Akheton designed the GVB Bakha, a fast, agile bomber that could still deliver a warship-shattering payload. The Bakha's dual Akh-12 engines are baffled and masked, giving it a small profile for heat-seeking missiles. The bomber's speed and maneuverability make it the craft of choice for taking out destroyers and corvettes with multiple flak, AAA, and anti-ship beam turrets. Over 6,000 Bakhas have been produced in the orbiting shipyards around Vasuda Prime.", 3116)   ;; ADD that it holds Terbuchet

+Tech Description:
XSTR("The GVG Anuket was originally designed for resource extraction in the volatile environment of gas giants. More recently, the Anuket has been modified for nebular operations. The Anuket has the most sophisticated sensor array available, enabling it to navigate the intense EM maelstroms of supernova remnants. In the nebula, the Anuket plays two important roles. First, the miner collects samples for scientific analysis and serves as a laboratory for field experiments. Second, the Anuket gathers deuterium-rich gas for use in the fusion drives that power the allied fleet.", 3130)

The Mentu's 16 turrets include heavy beam cannons for duking it out with other warships, as well as AAA and flak turrets to fend off smaller craft. The GVC Somtus and the GVC Mycerinus recently demonstrated the strength of the Mentu against NTF forces in Epsilon Pegasi.", 3132)

XSTR(
"The GVD Typhon was the height of Vasudan military technology when it appeared to face Terran forces during the early days of the Terran-Vasudan War. The first Typhon was sighted at the Vega Engagement and quickly destroyed the GTD Eisenhower and much of the 4th fleet. The more recent Hatshepsut class of destroyers is larger and wields a deadlier array of armaments, but the Typhon is still a match for almost any foe. Up to 30 wings of fighters or bombers can be housed within its docking bays, ready to engage at a moment's notice.", 3134)

$Name:						GVD Hatshepsut
$Short name:				VDestroy
$Species:					Vasudan
+Tech Description:
XSTR( "In 2360, Allied Command commissioned the first of the GVD Hatshepsut-class destroyers. The Vasudan contractor Akheton designed the Hatshepsut to efficiently integrate the new beam cannon. The process of retrofitting the older Typhon-class warships yielded vessels prone to system failures and reactor overloads. Though a handful of modified Typhons remain in service, the Hatshepsut has taken over as the primary Vasudan destroyer. With 24 turrets, 5 beam cannons, and 2 fighterbays, destroyers such as GVD Psamtik of Deneb's 13th Battle Group serve at the vanguard of the modern Vasudan fleet.", 3139)

XSTR(
"The SF Aeshma is a relatively rare, and only recently encountered, class of Shivan fighter. It appears to be a heavy attack fighter, like the Basilisk. With a low known top speed, Aeshmas seem to target slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible.", 3143)

XSTR(
"The SD Lucifer was a massive superdestroyer that led the Shivan armada in the Great War. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields. In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered ancient artifacts that explained how to track ships into subspace, where the Lucifer's shields would not function. A desperate mission to attack the Lucifer in subspace succeeded. But the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact with Earth. The victory over the Lucifer effectively ended the Shivan invasion.", 3162)
