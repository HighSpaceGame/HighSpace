46, "Special Operations Command

You have volunteered for a covert assignment with Special Operations Command (SOC), in conjunction with Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence (GTVI). 

Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA."

47, "Your Assignment

Missions with the Special Operations Command are carried out deep in enemy territory, with minimal logistical support. Our behind-the-lines activities include infiltration, sabotage, surgical strikes, and intelligence gathering. 

You will be working undercover within the Neo-Terran Front, leading Alpha wing of the 185th fighter squadron."

48, "Lt. Commander Snipes

Your contact in this mission is Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes, an allied officer who staged his defection to the NTF six months ago. As squadron leader of the 185th, Snipes will advise you of your mission objectives both as an NTF pilot and as an allied operative.

You will be equipped with a device that will enable you and Snipes to communicate over a secure frequency in battle. NTF ships will interpret your transmissions as targeting data."

49, "The ETAK Project

The focus of this covert operation is the NTF's ETAK project. Because access to information is restricted to the highest echelon, our knowledge here is limited. ETAK involves the development of a new, cutting-edge technology, possibly a weapon of mass destruction. 

Admiral Bosch oversees the project directly, and the rebels are constructing a prototype on the Iceni command ship. We need to get a closer look. Even a scan of the Iceni would be valuable."

50, "A Final Warning

We are working with the full cooperation of Vasudan Tactical Command and the Terran 6th Fleet. The probability that you will engage allied fighters will be minimal. However, should you come under allied attack, you have limited authorization to return fire in self-defense or to complete your mission objectives as defined by Lieutenant Commander Snipes. 

Show restraint, and use your judgement."

51, "This is Lieutenant Commander Snipes. For all you replacement pilots, welcome to the 185th. As you know, Admiral Koth's defeat in Epsilon Pegasi has opened the Polaris system to allied attack. At 1425 hours, GTVA expeditionary forces crossed our jump node blockade. The Colossus won't be far behind."

52, "Bosch isn't taking chances. We're moving the Iceni command ship to the Regulus system, where Bosch will install his provisional government. We've practiced this drill before, pilots. Alpha and Beta wing will escort the Iceni to the jump node. Delta, you're on standby."

53, "The Regulus node is located within a small asteroid field. Our job is to clear a path. Asteroids on a collision course with the Iceni will be indicated in white brackets on your HUD. That's how you know which asteroids to shoot. The gunners on the Iceni will help us out, so we shouldn't have too much trouble."

54, "All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is we got the Iceni and the Hinton to Regulus. The scan data you collected has been transmitted to the GTVI, and our operation to uncover the secret of ETAK continues as planned.

The bad news is we're in a lot more danger than I think you realize. The Vasudan warships were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our activities. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure has made the rebels just a little suspicious.

As usual, the GTVA is overplaying its hand. Ahmose and his subordinates now face a court martial for insubordination. The rebs are all over that one. Not only did the Admiral know the position of the Iceni, he wasn't authorized to act on that information. Our squadron will be high on the NTF's list of suspects. 

One more thing. The pilots under Ahmose's command had been informed of his renegade status before they launched their attack. Under these circumstances, we had little choice but to return fire or blow the entire operation.

Watch your back, pilot.  This ain't gonna get any easier. "

55, "All right, pilot. I've got some good news and some bad news. Good news is the Iceni has been destroyed along with Admiral Bosch and the ETAK project, whatever that was. 

The bad news is the allied warships that attacked the Iceni were under the command of Admiral Ahmose, who had full knowledge of our operation. The fact the Vasudans knew the exact time and position of the Iceni's departure to Regulus has made the rebels just a little suspicious. Counterintel double-checked the dossiers of all new pilots and found some discrepancies in your file.

As your superior officer, it is my duty to inform you that you will be executed at 2100 hours for crimes of espionage and high treason. Sorry it had to end this way, pilot."

56, "You did not have authorization to return to base. Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the NTF's objectives in this theatre. Unless Command decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Neo-Terran Front.

You will be confined to the brig pending your execution at 2100."

81, "<secure channel> That's strange. I don't know what any of this means. We'll see what our analysts come up with back home."

82, "<secure channel> Something's wrong here. Command said the Vasudans wouldn't attack until the Iceni left Polaris!"

83, "<secure channel> All right. Here are the rules. Neutralize anything that attacks the Iceni. Take out beam turrets and shoot down bombs."

84, "The Vasudans have destroyed the Hinton! Pilots, redouble your efforts! The Iceni must reach the Regulus system!"

85, "<secure channel> Either we've been double-crossed, or these Vasudans are not following orders! It's an us-or-them situation, pilot."

86, "<secure channel> If they fire on you, fire right back. If you don't defend yourself, you'll die out here, Alpha 1. These Vasudans are renegades!"

87, "Damn it, pilots! We lost the Iceni! Abort mission and return to base!"

88, "Love the Treason..."

89, "Snipes and Alpha 1 must hijack the NTT Sunder.
"

90, "As you have no doubt already heard, the GVD Psamtik has destroyed the NTD Cyrene, flagship of the Sirius fleet. As bad as things look in Polaris, the situation in Sirius is even worse. Bosch has redeployed our battle group to reinforce NTF positions in that system."

91, "We arrive in Sirius in six hours. The 185th will be deployed immediately to rendezvous with the NTT Sunder. Our mission will be to escort the transport back to the Regulus jump node. The cargo on board the Sunder has been classified well beyond my level of clearance. Let's just say if the Sunder goes down, so do we."

92, "The Alliance is fighting to secure the Alpha Centauri and Deneb jump nodes, so intelligence believes the risk of engagement will be low. Of course, that's what they told us in Polaris, where we got jumped by half the Vasudan armada. Expect the unexpected, kids, and report to the flight deck at 1310 sharp. Dismissed."

93, "Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The C.O. of the Sevrin has taken the brunt of Bosch's wrath for the Sunder's alleged destruction. The captain and his lieutenants have faced a summary court martial and will be executed at 0700. When you sign up for the wrong outfit, you get what you deserve.

This doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. The rebs are nuts, but they're not slow. It won't take them long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence. If it looks like they're on to you, your duty as an operative of the GTVI is to escape and report everything you know to allied forces. Understood?"

94, "Thanks to our heist, the Sunder is now in allied custody. With our scan of the Iceni and the capture of the rebel transport, the GTVI can begin to unravel the secret of Bosch's ETAK project. 

The destruction of the Hamaka forced our hand. The rebs are now fully aware that we're card-carrying members of Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence. As far as I'm concerned, we achieved the objectives of this covert operation. It wouldn't have taken the rebs long to figure out our involvement in this attack and the Vasudan ambush in Polaris was more than just coincidence.

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. It's been an honor working with you, pilot. Good luck!"

95, "You may proceed to the next GTVI mission only if the Hamako and Sunder survive."

96, "With the destruction of the Sunder, our heist failed. With only our scan of the Iceni to go on, unraveling the secret of Bosch's ETAK project will be nearly impossible. We invested six months into this operation and came away empty-handed. 

We're taking you to Deneb, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine there and continue with your next squadron assignment. Sorry your tour with the GTVI wasn't more successful, pilot. You had potential."

112, "The jamming devices should've blocked their transmissions to rebel command. But with the luck we're having, the NTF armada will arrive any second now."

114, "Command, do you copy? We've been set up! Alpha 1 and Beta 1 are traitors! We've been sabotaged!"

115, "Stand easy, pilots. We received a partial transmission reporting a reactor core breach. What happened to your squad?"

116, "We were ambushed by an allied heavy recon unit, flying some new kind of fighter. They splashed my squad and jumped before we could take them down."

117, "New kind of fighter, huh? You can tell us all about it at your debriefing. Why don't you rearm and repair, and we'll help you finish your escort."

118, "<secure channel>  Some of that transmission got through. I can't tell if they're on to us or not. Let's play their game for now. I've got some friends coming, so don't panic."

119, "Our mission, Alpha 1, is to highjack the NTT Sunder. The transport pilot is one of us, so he'll follow course. We need to make the rebels think the Sunder has been destroyed. A decoy transport will arrive in a few minutes."

120, "We've got more backup in transit, Alpha and Beta. We just need to hold down the fort a few minutes."

121, "Alpha 1, engage rebel fighters! Break to attack! Go! Go! Go!"

122, "Alpha 1, meet the 99th Skulls, Special Operations Command. The elite of the elite. Those fighters they're flying are the Erinyes class. As far anyone else knows, they don't even exist."

123, "We'll now scuttle this decoy transport. If the rebs think we destroyed the Sunder, they won't know how much we know. We'll also be able to continue our covert operation."

124, "Of course, that's if they don't hang us for failing the mission. We might be pushing our luck here, but what the hell."

125, "This is the NTCv Sevrin, 2nd Battle Group, Regulus. What is your status, pilots? We were instructed to rendezvous with a transport."

126, "Sevrin, you're late! Vasudans blasted my entire squad and two cruisers out here! You want a rendezvous? Scan that debris field! That's the Sunder right there! You're a disgrace to the NTF, Sevrin! I'm filing a report!"

127, "Stand down, Beta 1. We followed our orders to the letter. Now get back to base before the Vasudans return. There's nothing more we can do out here."

128, "You see the Hamako? That's the new AWACS ship. We're using it to block all enemy transmissions. As long as that ship remains operational, no one on the outside will know what we're up to. As far as the NTF is concerned, we're still loyal and devoted rebel pilots."

129, "So watch the Hamako, all right? If we lose the AWACS, our cover's blown for good."

130, "Keep your eye on the ball, kids. We're almost there. But if that decoy doesn't get here real soon, we'll have to bail."

131, "The Sunder is going down! All units, return to base. We blew this one big time."

132, "The NTC Mylae has jumped in. Watch the flak!"

133, "Nice shooting. The Mylae has been neutralized."

134, "Here comes the Hellespont, Aeolus-class."

135, "We've taken out the Hellespont. Well done, people."

136, "Okay, we've got the Naxos jumping in with the decoy! About time you guys made it.  Let's secure the area, and bring it on home."

137, "All right, Alpha 1. All we need to do is wait for the NTF. Hold your position."

138, "...But Hate the Traitor"

139, "Alpha 1 and the 185th attack a GTVA cargo depot.
"

140, "I'm Lieutenant Commander Jack Niven, your new squadron leader. Commander Snipes has been reassigned, so until further notice, you'll get your orders from me. With the 13th and 11th Vasudan battle groups advancing, we have a hard fight ahead of us. If we lose Sirius, our backs will be against the wall. The NTF has fought too hard to surrender now."

141, "The 4th Fleet, based in Vega, is providing the Vasudans with logistical support. They've established a cargo depot near the Alpha Centauri jump node. Recon reports a perimeter defense of 16 sentry guns, and fighter patrols inspect the depot at regular intervals. The 185th has been called in to sever that supply line. All targets are of Terran construction."

142, "Our attack will be timed between fighter patrols. Our objective is to destroy all cargo and sentry guns. Once we secure the area, we'll be in a position to ambush allied targets. The attack should lure the enemy to the depot and improve our odds in more critical engagements deeper in the system."

143, "We are lucky to get you back alive, pilot. Our deep-cover operatives stashed vital schematic data in your fighter's on board computer. With this information, GTVI analysts will be able to unravel the enigma of Bosch's ETAK project. 

These operatives also advised us of your impending execution. Unfortunately, we have no information concerning the whereabouts or status of Lieutenant Commander Snipes. We fear the odds of his survival are not favorable.

In recognition of your outstanding service to the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence and Special Operations Command, you are hereby awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Cross. With this honor, you are now one of an elite few. 

We will bring you as far as Vega, where you'll catch a transport back to Capella. You'll rendezvous with the Aquitaine and continue with your next squadron assignment. Congratulations on a successful tour with the GTVI."

144, "You willfully fired upon and destroyed a civilian transport. Allied Command has expressed its shock and dismay that an allied officer would indulge in the slaughter of innocent people. 

When you received your commission in the GTVA, you swore a solemn oath to lay down your life for all citizens of the Alliance. You swore to uphold the Beta Aquilae Convention, which explicitly forbids attacks against civilian vessels. Your actions violate every ethical principle we as a civilization hold sacred, and you will be made to answer for these crimes.

You will be held in custody pending your preliminary hearing. If you are indicted, you will be brought before the war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae. "

You have been selected for a covert assignment with Special Operations Command (SOC), in conjunction with Galactic Terran-Vasudan Intelligence (GTVI). Our primary objective is to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA."

171, "Lieutenant Commander Snipes

At 0437 reconnaissance units received a coded transmission from Lieutenant Commander Snipes. The Commander's vessel, the NTT Grall, is now adrift in a Shivan-infested region of the nebula and will not survive much longer. The Grall was docked to the NTC Alexandria when the cruiser ran our blockade of the Knossos portal in Gamma Draconis."

172, "S.O.S.

Here is part of the actual transmission.  We processed the message to enable better comprehension:

Granite Mountain, this is Black Dove requesting immediate extraction.  Engines and jump drives are inoperative.  Location, Delta 429 by 372.  Deployed Pharos beacons to assist search.  Heavy Shivan presence. Severe nebula storms.  Probability of survival not good."

173, "Allied Retreat

As you know, Allied forces are in full retreat to Gamma Draconis, so logistical support will be virtually non-existent. We have no available reinforcements and only one recovery ship. We're operating in a Shivan-infested area, so expect a fierce enemy offensive. The odds are against you on this one, pilot."

174, "You know why you're here, pilot, so let's get down to work. Recon located a Pharos navigation buoy not far from where Snipes's transmission was received. Your wing will be inserted at that position to find the Grall and make contact with Snipes. His transport has been incapacitated, and there's a high probability he's already a goner."

175, "This sector of the nebula is extremely volatile. Recon reports heavy EM interference, scrambling sensors and communications. These buoys are the only chance we have of finding Snipes and the Grall. The EM storm will make aspect lock difficult to acquire and maintain, so we recommend you loadout with Tempests and Rockeyes."

176, "Once you locate Snipes, call in Lambda 1. This is critical. Do not deploy the recovery craft until you are ready. Our transport will dock with the Grall and extract the survivors. You'll need to buy them some time as they complete this procedure. Good hunting. "

177, "Congratulations, pilot. You saved my life, and I owe you big. If I had more clout with the brass, I'd have them give you a Service Medallion, but they don't just hand those out. You didn't have to volunteer for this assignment, but I'm damn glad you did.

Now here's an important lesson. SOC didn't mount a rescue op because they liked me. They did it because I had information they needed, and information is what keeps you alive out here. Now I'm heading up the 99th for another mission, and I think we're going need you on this one. I already cleared it with Command, so it's your call, pilot. Hope you do the right thing."

178, "Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes distinguished himself as one of the best operatives ever to serve in the SOC. His courage, resourcefulness, and determination helped us defeat Admiral Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front. Snipes worked deep-cover for over six months, advising the GTVI of the enemy's movements, strategies, and capabilities. His career will stand as a shining example of service and sacrifice to the GTVA and the ideals for which the Alliance stands.

Lieutenant Commander Snipes is hereby posthumously awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the GTVA Special Operations Command. I know of no officer more worthy of such recognition."

179, "Protect the Grall as its passengers are being transferred to the recovery craft."

180, "You did not have authorization to return to base, pilot. Your actions jeopardized the lives of those involved in this mission and the GTVA's objectives in this theatre. Desertion is grounds for a court martial, and you are confined to quarters pending your preliminary hearing. Until a military court decides otherwise, you are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance."

196, "Roger that, SOC. Snipes here. Much obliged. Hope you brought a transport."

197, "Call in the transport when you are ready, Alpha 1."

198, "I say again. Call in the transport when ready. We must initiate the recovery procedure ASAP."

199, "Survivors are on board, sir. Release docking point now."

200, "Extraction complete. Return to base."

201, "All units, return to base pronto!"

202, "NTT Grall, this is GTVA Special Operations Command. We are here to recover your craft. Do you copy?"

203, "You're lucky we found you, Snipes. What happened out here?"

204, "The Shivans swarmed us near Gamma Drac, so we made an emergency jump. The rest is history."

205, "How many survivors?"

206, "17 of us made it to the transport. The shockwave banged us up pretty bad. Comm and life support were all we had to work with out here."

207, "What about the nav buoys?"

208, "The Alexandria deployed them. We couldn't rely on navigation or sensors, so that was our best option."

209, "You have any information for us?"

210, "Yeah, but I classified that on a need-to-know basis. And until you get us outta here, you don't need to know. "

211, "Into the Lion's Den"

212, "Snipes leads Alpha wing of the 99th Skulls on a mission through the second Knossos portal.
"

213, "Here's the situation. Allied Command has ordered the full retreat of all GTVA forces. They've written off Gamma Draconis, so they're moving the armada into Capella to hold down the system. Meanwhile, SOC needs a unit to fly suicide to check out a second Knossos device the Vasudans found deep in the nebula."

214, "To give us a fighting chance, our unit will fly a wing of Shivan fighters SOC forces captured early in the nebula campaign. Our engineers have modified and optimized these craft. They'll handle even better than the Shivan original, and if you play it right, you might even avoid enemy detection. "

215, "We're going in with a handpicked squad. You'll fly Alpha 1. I've got Alpha 2. Two of our top pilots, Xinny and Zero, will cover Alphas 3 and 4, respectively. Our Maras will be equipped with intersystem jump drives so we can use the node."

216, "The timetable for this mission is 15 minutes. We'll jump in, gather data, hold down the fort, then jump out. Your drives will be inoperative inside a window of exactly 15 seconds. If we miss our jump, the recovery ship will leave us behind. There's no room for error."

217, "Here's something else to think about. By the time we launch, we'll be the only allied operatives left in the nebula. There'll be no reinforcement, no support, and no base to run to. That's why this mission has to be carried out by the numbers. We have fifteen minutes. No more. No less."

218, "Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. GTVA analysts are now reviewing our flight data.

Unfortunately, we failed to destroy a single one of those Shivan devices. The Alliance demands top-notch flying from its elite squads, and our performance out there was a little disappointing. At least we were able to warn the Alliance.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

219, "It is possible to destroy the Shivan device that you discovered."

220, "Good work, Alpha 1. Most pilots only get to fly one suicide mission. We survived what should've been our last sortie. I've advised the GTVI that multiple Juggernaut-class warships are now en route to the Capella system. We'll have our hands full getting everyone out of there alive.

By the way, nice work destroying that Shivan technology. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

For helping to provide the Alliance with accurate and comprehensive information regarding the tactics, technologies, activities, and strategic objectives of forces hostile to the GTVA, you are hereby awarded the SOC Service Medallion, the most prestigious honor bestowed by Special Operations Command. Congratulations.

It's been a privilege and an honor, pilot. Allied Command has reassigned you to the GTD Aquitaine. Rumor has it you'll be leading the 70th Blue Lions, and I can't think of a better pilot for the job. Good luck."

Great work neutralizing those Shivan devices. You delivered a top-notch performance. Analysts are poring over the scan data now, but you can rest assured the results will be classified beyond your level of clearance. They always are.

"

253, "Reconnaissance has located a Moloch-class Shivan corvette, designation $h Nosferatu, in the Gamma Draconis system. Allied forces have tangled with the $h Nosferatu before in this theater of operations, and we've lost many good pilots in the struggle."

254, "Intelligence believes the corvette was en route to reinforce the Shivan fleet near the Capella jump node. However, the vessel aborted its subspace jump before it could reach its destination, perhaps because of an engine or navigation subsystem failure."

255, "With the corvette isolated from the main Shivan force, we now have an opportunity to take it out of circulation. Your mission is to destroy the $h Nosferatu and its fighter complement. Command will commit no more than one wing for this sortie, and we have just one chance. Given your exemplary combat record, we are confident you are up to the challenge."

256, "Well done, Alpha wing. Outnumbered and outgunned, you destroyed the Nosferatu and its fighters before they could wreak havoc on the front lines. Your actions today avenged the deaths of those who lost their lives fighting this warship. Command will be very pleased with this outcome."

257, "Good work, Alpha. You destroyed the Nosferatu before it could wreak havoc on the front lines. Your actions today avenged the deaths of those who lost their lives fighting this warship. Regrettably, some of the Dragon fighters survived the assault. As you know, Dragons are among the most formidable fighters in the Shivan arsenal, and reducing their numbers is always a high priority. Nevertheless, you achieved your primary objective."

258, "Although you neutralized the Nosferatu's fighter complement, you failed to achieve your primary objective. Consequently, the Nosferatu remains a formidable threat to our forces in the Gamma Draconis system. Needless to say, Command will be disappointed with this outcome."

259, "Be sure to take along at least two bombers to destroy the Nosferatu."

260, "Command will not be pleased with your failure to destroy the Nosferatu or its fighters. You were selected for this mission because the Allied leadership had faith in your ability to perform under pressure. Unfortunately, our assessment of your skills is significantly off the mark.

Shivan battle groups continually try to gain control of this node and enter the system beyond. We cannot let them. The $f 32nd $f Battle $f Group is engaged with the Shivans on the other side of the node. Our patrol begins in 15 minutes. That is all, pilots."

275, "The Shivans have broken through to the Epsilon Pegasi system. You could have prevented this, if you had performed better. The 32nd has failed to report in.

are for every $f NTF battle group to send half its strength to the Deneb system immediately. There's an offensive planned and Bosch wants to gather forces before striking. Our group will send the three warships you helped us capture in your previous mission."

283, "The ships have been repaired and re-commissioned as the $f Retribution, $f Righteous, and the $f Vindication. I've called you here today because there's a problem. The $h GTVA has apparently gotten wind of Bosch's plans and has moved to prevent him from gathering more force."

284, "A $h GTVA battle group is now blocking our path to the Deneb jump node. Our scouts confirmed the presence of a strong force, but could not penetrate the screening cover of fighters to get an accurate ship count. "

285, "We have to go in to clear the way for our warships to reach the jump node. Since we're not sure what we'll encounter, individual assignments will be made by me once we arrive. We need to do our job no matter what's out there. The $f Retribution, $f Righteous, and $f Vindication must make it through the blockade.  Everything else is secondary."

286, "The cargo we acquired from the $h GTVA held the parts we needed to repair a few Erinyes-class fighters. You'll find them on the flight deck
when you're selecting your ships. Be ready to fly in 15 minutes."

287, "That was excellent flying, pilots! It was a tough assignment, but you came through with a great performance. Getting our warships past the GTVA blockade is a tremendous boost to NTF morale and can't help but further your career. Stand down, pilots. You've earned a good rest."

288, "No recommendation available."

289, "This mission was a complete disaster. Though it was a tough assignment, you should have done much better. Thousands of lives were lost today, and you're at least partly to blame. I'll decide later whether you'll ever fly for us again. Dismissed."

290, "Try the mission again. If you can't complete it, perhaps the difficulty setting is too high."

291, "This mission was a partial success, but we should have done much better. We should eradicate every Vasudan target that presents itself. By letting the Murakami escape, we ensured that it'll make our lives miserable another day. Next time, let's have a clean mission with no loose ends. Dismissed."

This is Admiral Petrarch, commanding officer of the GTD Aquitaine. For those squadrons joining us here in Vega, welcome aboard. 

With a complement of 150 combat spacecraft, the Aquitaine serves as flagship of the GTVA 3rd Fleet, based in the Capella system. You join an elite crew of 10,000, the finest officers and enlisted personnel serving the Alliance today."

508, "The Neo-Terran Front

After 18 months of fighting, Admiral Bosch's Neo-Terran Front has become the most significant threat to regional security since the Great War ended 32 years ago. 

The NTF demands the independence of their systems and the revocation of the Beta Aquilae Convention, or BETAC. The BETAC treaty centralized power in the GTVA as the supreme authority in Terran-Vasudan space."

509, "The Ideology of Neo-Terra

Integral to NTF ideology is Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra, a utopian society where the lost grandeur of Earth will be restored. Bosch and his followers oppose any alliance with the Vasudans as a threat to the future of the human race.

The rebels are entrenched in Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius. But before we hit these strongholds, we must secure Epsilon Pegasi, Alpha Centauri, and Deneb. These contested systems are now the focal point of allied operations."

510, "The Battle of Deneb

Allied Command has ordered the Aquitaine into the Deneb system. There we will reinforce the 13th Vasudan Battle Group, led by the GVD Psamtik. 

Both the NTF and the GTVA have sustained heavy casualties in the battle for Deneb. In the past seventy-two hours, we have lost the GVC Andromeda, the GTC Trafalgar, and over 15 fighter wings. Command anticipates the arrival of the Aquitaine and the Psamtik will shift the battle for Deneb in our favor and force the NTF to withdraw to Sirius."

511, "This is Captain Loukakis, squadron leader of the 53rd Hammerheads. At 0320 hours, the $f Aquitaine entered the Deneb system. Admiral Petrarch launched fighter and bomber wings as part of an all-out attack against $h NTF positions throughout the system. He has kept the Hammerheads on standby, until now."

512, "A situation is developing near the inhabited planet of Cygnus Prime. We have over 100,000 Vasudan refugees fleeing their colonies in transports. Allied ships are rescuing the Vasudans as quickly as possible, though the logistics of this operation leave many refugees still vulnerable to rebel attack."

513, "At 0545, we received a distress signal from a refugee convoy 900 clicks, or kilometers, from the outer orbit of Cygnus Prime. The Vasudans responded with a wing of Serapis fighters, designated Epsilon, which have just called in for reinforcements. Alpha wing, you're going in."

514, "Because these transports do not have jump drives, you must protect the convoy until a recovery ship arrives. With all warships engaged and other convoys in dire need of protection, we do not know when a craft will become available. Command will keep you updated and send in reinforcements as needed."

515, "Good work, pilot. You held off the rebel attack and saved both Vasudan transports from destruction. Your squadmates and I all agree: you'll make a fine addition to the 53rd Hammerheads. Command reports that 75 percent of the refugees have been recovered with few casualties. The remaining 25 percent are under allied protection and will be rescued shortly. We have also won major victories against the NTF.  The NTD Jacobus and the NTC Hengst have been destroyed, and our blockades of the Alpha Centauri and Sirius jump nodes has isolated the rebel fleet. Furthermore, 600,000 ground troops will soon land on the surface of Cygnus Prime in our effort to retake the planet. Prepare for your next mission, pilot. The battle for Deneb is not over yet."

516, "As officers of the GTVA, we have sworn to protect all citizens of the Alliance. The destruction of the Iota transport is unfortunate, pilot. If this were not your first sortie, I would recommend your immediate transfer out of the fighter corps. We'll give you another chance.

Command reports heavy casualties among the Vasudan refugee convoys. Only 50 percent have been recovered, and the survivors remain at great risk. 

Our efforts to drive the rebels out of Deneb have stalled. Though we destroyed the NTC Hengst, we have lost the GTC Coriolanus and the GVC Mirage. Blockade runners continue to supply the rebel fleet, and the operation to liberate Cygnus Prime has been delayed.

The Alliance remains committed to this counter-insurgency effort, though the battle for Deneb will not be won without sacrifice."

517, "Engage the rebel fighters before they reach the transports. Use your missiles to take them down quickly, and stay close to the convoy."

518, "As officers of the GTVA, we have sworn to protect all citizens of the Alliance. The destruction of both Iota transports is a travesty, pilot. You have disgraced the 53rd Hammerheads, and I will recommend your immediate discharge from the fighter corps.

The Alliance's offensive is now in shambles. Only 25 percent of the Vasudan refugees have been recovered, while the NTF continues to massacre thousands without mercy. 

Command reports we have lost the GTD Aeneas, the GTC Coriolanus, and the GVC Mirage. Our efforts to blockade the Alpha Centauri and Sirius jump nodes have failed. The Security Council will order the fleet to withdraw from Deneb and negotiate terms with the NTF."

566, "Alpha 1, your mission is to seek and destroy all targets of opportunity, including freighters, cargo, and sentry guns. $f Beta wing will scan the cargo. Recon sighted a wing of $h Lokis guarding the depot, so prioritize these bandits."

567, "Do not underestimate the importance of this mission, pilot. A depot raid won't win you any medals, but it can be just as vital as taking down a cruiser or corvette.  We must sever rebel supply lines if we want to achieve a decisive victory."

568, "Command has issued no official explanation for Admiral Bosch's presence in the Deneb system. The hidden base and the shielded cargo units only compound the mystery of the admiral's agenda. Under the circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to stop the escape of Bosch's command frigate, designated the NTF Iceni."

620, "Admiral Bosch's command frigate reached the Sirius jump node. I have received no explanation, neither on nor off the record, for what happened out there. I assume we'll be informed on a need-to-know basis.

Good job neutralizing those fighters and freighters. You've served the 53rd Hammerheads well. Your performance in this last mission proves you have what it takes to be an ace pilot. I have recommended your transfer to the 107th Ravens. They lost many good officers in Deneb, and they could use someone with your talents. They're a top-notch unit. I know you'll make us proud.  

Good luck with your new assignment, pilot. Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will address the crew at 0630."

621, "You have successfully completed this mission."

622, "Admiral Bosch's command frigate reached the Sirius jump node. I have received no explanation, neither on nor off the record, for what happened out there. I assume we'll be informed on a need-to-know basis.

Though you performed well under difficult circumstances, we should have destroyed that rebel freighter before it departed the system. 

You will no longer be flying with the 53rd Hammerheads. I have recommended your transfer to the 107th Ravens. Eighty percent of their unit was wiped out in Deneb, so they're desperate for new pilots.

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will address the crew at 0630."

666, "After the Shivans attack an allied warship in Capella, the 107th Ravens are deployed to secure a mysterious subspace portal in the Gamma Draconis system."

667, "Shivan Attack

To the officers and crew of the GTD Aquitaine, this is Admiral Petrarch. At 0115 hours, we received a transmission from 3rd Fleet Headquarters. A Shivan cruiser and three fighter wings ambushed and destroyed the GTC Vigilant as it patrolled the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. 

Command deployed the GTD Carthage and GVCv Dahshor. Though these vessels neutralized the immediate threat, all allied units are now in a state of enhanced vigilance."

668, "Gamma Draconis

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to spearhead the operation in Gamma Draconis as we investigate the origin and extent of this incursion.

Gamma Draconis is a remote, uninhabited system discovered shortly before the outbreak of the Great War. The system has no planets and no viable resources. The GTSC Erikson visited the system 15 years ago and reported nothing out of the ordinary."

669, "A Subspace Portal?

Recon flights in Gamma Draconis detected activity near an uncharted jump node. Closer examination has revealed this node is not a natural phenomenon but a massive subspace portal of unknown origin.  

We do not know why the Erikson failed to detect the portal when it last visited the system. This device may have been inactive and therefore invisible to long-range sensors, or it may be of recent construction."

670, "The Shivans

The Shivan vessels that destroyed the Vigilant were not of any class encountered in the Great War. The light cruiser, designated Rakshasa, and the fighters, designated Mara, have been added to your on-board database.

This is our first contact with this species in over three decades. Our objectives are clear. We must secure Gamma Draconis or face annihilation a second time."

671, "This is Lieutenant Samsa, squadron leader of the 107th Ravens. Here's the situation. The $f GTD $f Aquitaine entered Gamma Draconis at 1640. The flagship will defend the Capella node as we advance to secure the system. Recon discovered a Shivan supply depot near the subspace portal, and this will be our target."

672, "Command believes the Shivans are preparing for a more aggressive attack on Capella. The $h SC $h Behemoth, a Rakshasa-class cruiser, guards the depot with a wing of Mara fighters. Enemy freighters are entering the system, dropping their cargo, and departing through the portal. Your mission, pilot, is to execute a clean sweep of the area."

673, "Your primary target will be the Mara fighters. Once the escorts are down, destroy the $h Behemoth and any freighters in the vicinity. You'll need to hold down the fort until we deploy the $f Carthage and $f Dahshor. After you secure the area, we'll send wings Delta and Epsilon to relieve you."

674, "You survived your first sortie against the Shivans. Though we had only a small opposing force to contend with, survival is half the battle. The C.O.s of both the Carthage and Dahshor commend our squadron for the outstanding cover we provided. The Shivan Cain cruiser and its complement of fighters might have destroyed these vessels had we not intervened. Well done, pilot.

A joint Terran-Vasudan task force, under the direction of Dr. Mina Hargrove, is now studying the subspace portal. We expect a preliminary report in a few hours."

675, "You survived your first sortie against the Shivans. Though we had only a small opposing force to contend with, survival is half the battle. Tragically, the 10,000 men and women on board the Carthage were not so lucky. As a unit, we must accept the blame for this catastrophe. Had we fought harder, we could have saved that destroyer. A service for the dead will be held at 0100 hours on Deck 36.

A joint Terran-Vasudan task force, under the direction of Dr. Mina Hargrove, is now studying the subspace portal. We expect a preliminary report in a few hours."

676, "Stay focused on the Shivan bombers."

677, "You survived your first sortie against the Shivans. Though we had only a small opposing force to contend with, survival is half the battle. Tragically, the 6,000 Vasudan officers and crew on board the Dahshor were not so lucky. As a unit, we must accept the blame for this catastrophe. Had we fought harder, we could have saved that cruiser. A Vasudan service for the dead will be held at 0100 hours on Deck 36.

A joint Terran-Vasudan task force, under the direction of Dr. Mina Hargrove, is now studying the subspace portal. We expect a preliminary report in a few hours."

678, "Over 16,000 Terrans and Vasudans perished in this engagement. That our squadron failed to stop this massacre is a disgrace. As officers and pilots of the 107th Ravens, our honor will be stained with the blood of our comrades. Had we fought harder, we could have saved the Carthage and the Dahshor."

721, "The 107th patrols the nebula beyond the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis."

722, "Research Task Force

With the Gamma Draconis system secure, a task force of Terran and Vasudan scientists is now examining the subspace portal. At this point, the scientists have ruled out the possibility the device is of Shivan origin. 

Dr. Mina Hargrove, leader of the research team, has issued a report of its preliminary findings. An excerpt of this report follows."

723, "Dr. Hargrove, Task Force Preliminary Findings (Excerpt)

The subspace portal is unlike any Shivan construction we have yet encountered. Though Shivans demonstrate considerable diversity as a species, all Shivan technology possesses certain distinctive properties. None is present in the subspace device, which means we must look elsewhere for the portal's origin. We do know that the device is very, very old, on the order of several thousand years."

724, "Subspace Vortices

The field generated by the interlocking movement of the portal's components creates a subspace vortex, connecting one part of the universe to another.  Dr. Hargrove theorizes that whoever built this device may have used it to stabilize a jump node on the verge of collapse. 

If Dr. Hargrove is correct, this technology is a tremendous discovery."

725, "A Way Home?

By constructing our own portal, we might be able to reopen the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis. Since the destruction of the Lucifer caused the node to collapse thirty-two years ago, Earth has remained isolated from the GTVA. 

We might also be able to stabilize subspace nodes that are currently too volatile for travel, thus creating routes to systems previously unexplored."

726, "Beyond the Portal

Our military operation will focus on what lies on the other side of the subspace portal. We must determine where the node leads and the extent of the Shivan presence there. Above all, we must prevent the Shivans from returning to Gamma Draconis. 

Because the portal will remain active while the research team studies the technology, our systems are vulnerable to attack.  Allied Command has deemed this an acceptable risk given the potential benefits."

727, "At 1540 hours, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine entered the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis and jumped to our current position. We have entered a nebula, a vast and dense ionized field, and possibly the remnant of a supernova. We have travelled farther than any Terrans in the history of subspace travel. "

728, "The nebula has severely limited the Aquitaine's long-range sensors. We are deploying our fighter wings to explore the immediate vicinity and determine the extent of the enemy presence. Each fighter squadron will deploy a flight of four wings. "

729, "Alpha, Zeta, Iota, and Kappa will patrol a series of four waypoints. Zeta wing will lead this sortie, so follow Zeta 1 and do not stray. Be advised the nebula could interfere with your on-board systems. The ionized field will compromise your sensors, even within combat range. "

730, "You confronted an overwhelming Shivan force in a hostile environment. Under these circumstances, there was nothing you or anyone else could have done to save the Trinity and our boarding party. You were lucky to survive this sortie, pilot. 

We have heard nothing from Kappa wing since they vanished from our sensors. Unfortunately, we must presume the worst. They will be listed MIA unless we find evidence to the contrary. Our search parties have found no trace of these fighters. 

The presence of the Trinity deepens the enigma of the NTF's secret agenda. What was the Trinity doing out here, and what does Bosch know about the subspace portal? 

All patrols have uncovered an extensive Shivan force in the nebula. Command will deploy more warships through the subspace portal to assist with our mission of exploration and containment. Iota and Epsilon wings encountered two Shivan cruisers near our current location. When our reinforcements arrive, we will move against them."

744, "Hostile targets confirmed! A wing of Manticores closing fast!"

745, "I'm picking up something on sensors. I can't get a lock!"

746, "Hold on. I've got a visual on something big. A cruiser or corvette."

747, "Do you recognize the configuration? Is it a Rakshasa or a Cain?"

757, "Roger that, Command. Iota jumping out now."

758, "OK, let's get back on patrol.  Alpha follow my lead."

759, "Alpha 1, return to base."

760, "Alpha, you have your orders."

761, "Alpha, we are preparing to vacate the recovery point. Jump out now, or we'll leave you behind!"

764, "Kappa wing, this is Allied Command. Please respond."

765, "Iota wing, investigate Kappa's last waypoint. The ionized field is interfering with our transmission."

766, "Good luck, pilots. Keep a tight formation, and look out for each other. Let's all get home alive."

767, "This is Zeta 1. All clear. "

768, "Pilots, destroy those fighters, and stay alert. Watch for a flanking maneuver."

769, "No problem, Command. We'll take 'em down."

770, "Resume your patrol, pilots."

771, "There's got to be a base or destroyer in this nebula somewhere. Those fighters couldn't survive out here on their own."

772, "This nebula could be ten or twenty light years in diameter. Finding a single ship would be impossible."

773, "Unless the Shivans find us first."

774, "Do we have a status update on Kappa wing?"

775, "Negative. No word from Kappa yet. We'll find out in debriefing. "

776, "How are we supposed to get a visual confirmation? I can't see a thing in this mess!"

777, "Rather be fighting the NTF if you ask me. I never signed on for hunting Shivans."

778, "Don't kid yourself. We're the ones being hunted, pilot. "

779, "Command should shut down that portal and send the Aquitaine back to Deneb. We've got no business being out here."

780, "If Command needs your opinion, they'll promote you to admiral. Now shut up and focus."

781, "Hostile indicators on radar!"

782, "Detecting at least one wing of Manticores. Let's make this quick."

783, "There's no allied ship authorized in your vicinity. Hail them, pilot."

784, "This is Zeta wing of the 107th Ravens, GTD Aquitaine. Please identify yourself."

785, "This is Captain Arthur Roemig of the GTC Trinity. We have sustained heavy damage, and our jump drive is inoperative. We need immediate assistance."

786, "Your designation is incorrect, Roemig. Your ship defected to the NTF ten days ago. You have been stripped of your rank and citizenship in the GTVA. Surrender the Trinity or be destroyed."

787, "As captain of the NTC Trinity, I surrender on the condition you get us the hell out of here."

788, "What's your status?"

789, "We repelled a Shivan attack but engines sustained critical damage. I powered down non-essential systems so the Shivans wouldn't detect us. We've been drifting ever since."

790, "What's your assessment of the damage?"

791, "Some components were destroyed in the attack, but my chief engineer thinks a field repair is possible."

792, "We will send a damage control team with the necessary components. Transmit your diagnostics."

793, "Transmitting now."

794, "What were you doing out here, Roemig?"

795, "As a prisoner of war, my rights are protected under the Beta Aquilae Convention. I will answer no questions, Command."

796, "I thought rebels didn't recognize BETAC."

797, "No, but we do, pilot. Damage control has been deployed. They should be arriving momentarily."

798, "Trinity standing by."

799, "More hostiles incoming!"

800, "Keep the Shivans away from the Trinity, pilots. That ship won't survive another attack. Give us a time estimate, Discovery."

801, "We can jury-rig a solution in 15 minutes, Command. "

802, "Can you bring the anti-fighter turrets on line?"

803, "Negative. We need all power on engines. "

804, "We can't hold them back forever, Trinity! Hurry up with those repairs!"

805, "You need to buy us more time, pilots!"

806, "Check your distance, Alpha."

807, "Alpha 1, you're falling behind. We can't wait for stragglers."

808, "Don't stray too far, Alpha 1, or you might lose me in this soup."

809, "Use your burners to keep up, Alpha."

810, "Alpha 1, divert extra power to your engines if you need more speed."

811, "Check your formation, Alpha 1."

816, "The 107th assists the GTCv Lysander and GTCv Actium on a search-and-destroy mission in the nebula."

817, "With recent victories on the civil war front, the GTVA Security Council has authorized the deployment of two Deimos-class corvettes into the nebular theatre of operations. The $f Lysander and the $f Actium crossed the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis at 2335 hours and joined up with the $f Aquitaine's battle group."

818, "On their last sortie, $f Epsilon and $f Iota wings encountered two Shivan warships: a Rakshasa-class cruiser designated the $r Iblis and a Lilith-class cruiser designated the $r Asuras. Admiral Petrarch has instructed our corvettes to hunt down and destroy these vessels. The 107th will provide fighter cover."

819, "Alpha wing, your mission is to escort the Lysander and the Actium as they carry out this assault. Your first priority will be to eliminate all hostile fighters and bombers. Only then will you assist the corvettes with their strike against the Shivan warships.  If we lose either corvette, you will abort the mission and withdraw from the field immediately."

820, "Our primary objective was to defend those corvettes, and we as a unit failed. Our blunders resulted in thousands of casualties and the destruction of an allied corvette. This is no simulator, pilot. When we make mistakes, lives are lost. Command will have no choice but to re-evaluate our objectives in the nebula. Regardless of whether this debacle was our fault or the result of Command's miscalculation, our squadron will play the scapegoat."

821, "Monitor the hull integrity of the ships you are assigned to protect, and destroy the Shivan bombers first. Do not let the enemy lure you away from the corvettes."

822, "The Shivan warship we encountered has been designated the SD Ravana. Allied forces have been deployed to engage this vessel. 

Given the number of Shivan fighters our wings have encountered, we knew an enemy destroyer had to be lurking somewhere within the nebula. Our impaired visibility and diminished sensor range made locating their base of operations difficult. Command hoped our offensive against the two Shivan cruisers would lure the destroyer from its hiding place. Under these circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to save the corvettes from destruction. 

Admiral Petrarch has informed me that the 107th may be called in to reinforce the vessels attacking the Ravana. Suit up for your next sortie, pilot."

823, "Our primary objective was to defend those corvettes, and we as a unit failed. Our blunders resulted in thousands of casualties and the destruction of the Lysander and the Actium.

848, "No shields. No flak guns. No beam cannons."

849, "Hey, Command. You gonna tell us what the rebels are doing out here?"

"

868, "This is Lieutenant Samsa. The allied attack against the $h SD $h Ravana has deteriorated. We've lost the $f GTD $f Delacroix, and the surviving warships in the battle group are damaged. Petrarch is scrambling the 107th to assist. Command will also sortie the $f GVC $f Somtus and the $f GTC $f Yakiba. Once they cross the subspace portal, we will move them into position."

869, "For this mission, we'll fly the GTB Boanerges, the Alliance's new attack bomber. The Boanerges maximizes shielding and payload, while offering enough manueverability to make it a viable tactical unit. The bomber won't handle as well as the Herc II, so stay on the move. Bombers make easy targets."

870, "With our Cyclops torpedoes, we'll have the firepower to take out the $h Ravana. If you're too far from the target, the flak guns will neutralize your bomb, so get as close as possible. Once you fire your salvo, hit your burners to get clear of the blast. The Cyclops has an extensive lock time and countdown."

871, "If we succeed, we will have secured the jump node between the nebula and Gamma Draconis. If we fail, we pave the way for a Shivan invasion of our systems. Good luck, pilot. We know you can do it."

872, "The destruction of the Ravana is the most significant victory over the Shivans since the end of the Great War. We have secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis, and we have demonstrated our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. We have proven without a doubt that we have the firepower to neutralize any Shivan threat. 

A new class of intercept fighter will be stationed on board the Aquitaine. I have recommended that you be transferred to this unit. Interceptors are fast, high-performance fighters requiring pilots with good reflexes. You've got the talent for it, and you'll represent the Ravens well.  

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system. Admiral Petrarch will brief the crew about our upcoming operation."

873, "In the aftermath of this debacle, we are faced with the prospect of fighting an all-out war on multiple fronts. Somebody will have to take the fall for this, and it's going to be the 107th. Command has disbanded our unit and will reassign its survivors to new posts in the allied fleet. Frankly, I think we'll be lucky if they let us fly support ships. Dismissed."

874, "Monitor the hull integrity of your allied ships. It helps to disarm the Ravana early in the mission."

875, "We destroyed the Ravana and secured the subspace node linking the nebula with Gamma Draconis. However, with our losses, this victory is Pyrrhic at best. The Delacroix, the Champion, the Khenmu, the Heisenberg, the Yakiba, and the Somtus all perished in this engagement.  

With the heavy casualties we have suffered, Admiral Petrarch will reorganize the Aquitaine's fighter squadrons. As captain of the 107th Ravens, it is my sad duty to report that after forty years of service, our unit will be disbanded. 

Command has ordered the Aquitaine to return to the Capella system, and there we will receive our new assignments."

895, "Enif Massacre

36 hours ago, the NTF launched a full-scale offensive in Epsilon Pegasi, taking the GTVA 6th Fleet by surprise. Commanding his forces from the NTD Repulse, Rear Admiral Koth leads the rebel advance. With 75 percent of our forces in this system decimated, the regional death toll since the incursion now exceeds 80,000.
 
Unless we act quickly, a decisive rebel victory is imminent."

896, "Stalemate in Sirius

The GTD Aquitaine will lead the allied counterstrike against Koth and his warships. We will resupply in Capella before shipping out to the front. 

We have also learned our campaign in Sirius has failed. A two-pronged offensive launched from Alpha Centauri and Deneb encountered fierce resistance. Unless we can devise a military solution for dealing with the rebels, the GTVA will be forced to recognize the NTF's authority in Sirius, Regulus, and Polaris."

897, "On the Vanguard

Allied engineers in the meantime are developing and adapting technologies that will enable us to fight more effectively in the nebula. Dr. Hargrove and her research team continue to study the subspace portal. Their findings have been classified level Phi.

Until the situation in Epsilon Pegasi has been normalized, the GTVA will suspend its operations in the nebula."

898, "This is Lieutenant Commander Cordova, leader of the 242nd Suicide Kings. Welcome to Epsilon Pegasi, pilots. $f Enif $f Station, the Alliance's base of operations in this system, is now under attack. Though we have destroyed the $h NTC $h Outrage, the $h Cato continues to bombard the installation with heavy beam fire."

899, "Evacuation of civilian personnel on board $f Enif $f Station is now in progress. As you know, civilians are protected under the Beta Aquilae Convention, but the $h NTF has rejected that treaty and its provisions. Fortunately, most of the civilian convoy has jumped safely to the Capella jump node."

900, "Your mission is to defend $f Enif $f Station. As leader of Alpha wing, you will command your squadmates to destroy the fighters and warships besieging our installation. If the rebels sortie their Zeus bombers, intercept the warheads before they impact the base. "

901, "Allied forces are engaging the rebels throughout the system. As resources become available, they will be deployed to assist you. Until we get these reinforcements, however, holding down the fort is all up to you. This sortie will be the first combat field test of the Perseus intercept fighter, so let's put on a good show."

902, "When you were selected for the 242nd Suicide Kings, you were singled out as a promising candidate for a command position. The officers who recommended you had faith in your potential to make an outstanding leader. Unfortunately, this assessment seems premature, at the very least.

I am disappointed in you, pilot. Though you probably fought well as an individual, you did not use your squadmates to the best advantage in this scenario. We lost Enif Station because you were placed in a situation you were ill-equipped to handle. That's not your fault. However, if you want to fly with a top-notch unit, you must learn the difference between doing an adequate job and going above and beyond the call of duty."

903, "Destroy beam turrets on hostile warships, and intercept enemy bombers. Order your squadmates to attack or protect targets you cannot cover."

904, "In your courageous defense of Enif Station, you were eyewitness to an historic moment: the first combat deployment of the GTVA Colossus. 

You and your wing also showed us what the Perseus intercept fighter can do. Against overwhelming odds, you repelled an attack against a facility of the utmost strategic importance for the Alliance. 

The commander of Enif Station personally extends his gratitude, pilot. I can see you'll make a fine addition to the Suicide Kings.

The Alliance has won battle after battle throughout the system, crushing the NTC Rapier, the NTC Explorer, and the NTD Normandy. These victories have stalled the rebel advance, and now with the help of the Colossus, we will push them back into the Polaris system, securing Epsilon Pegasi once and for all."

937, "Verify IFF status, Command!"

938, "IFF status is friendly. Meet the Colossus, the largest space-faring warship ever constructed."

939, "This is the GTVA Colossus. Fighters stand clear of hostile warships. All batteries, fire at will."

940, "Colossus, maintain your current position. You will defend Enif Station until relieved."

941, "Into the Maelstrom "

942, "The 242nd escorts a supply convoy through a rebel-infested asteroid field as they rendezvous with the Colossus."

943, "The 242nd will escort a supply convoy as it makes its rendezvous with the $f GTVA $f Colossus. As we prepare the $f Colossus for the allied counterattack, we must handle the logistics of supplying and maintaining this warship. Convoys of transports, gas miners, and freighters have been deployed for this purpose."

944, "The $f Colossus will jump in and rendezvous with your convoy at the Capella jump node, located on the far side of an asteroid field. The area has been the site of intense fighting and rebel activity. Intelligence believes the rebels might attempt to attack our supply convoys rather than challenge the $f Colossus directly."

945, "You will be leading Alpha wing, the main escort component. Your mission is to defend the $f GTFr $f Parracombe, the $f GTG $f Avila, and the $f GVG $f Jooyun. The $f Avila and $f Jooyun are mining vessels designed to collect fuel from gas giants for the reactors that power the $f Colossus."

946, "The Vasudans have dispatched a wing of Serapis fighters to guard the $f Jooyun. You do not have command over this unit. However, the 242nd Suicide Kings are responsible for the $f Jooyun's safety. Eighteen months of civil war are beginning to strain Terran-Vasudan relations, especially in contested systems. See to it the $f Jooyun survives."

947, "Excellent job, pilot. The convoy made its rendezvous with the Colossus without losing a single ship. As the other freighters and gas miners transfer their payload to the Colossus, the Alliance is making final preparations for our attack against Admiral Koth and the NTD Repulse. A demonstration of our ultimate weapon should force the rebel leadership to reconsider their territorial ambitions.  

GTVA units throughout the system report a successful, coordinated strike against NTF targets. Command is confident the long stalemate in Epsilon Pegasi will soon come to a favorable resolution. "

948, "Admiral Petrarch and the 242nd have issued a formal apology to the Vasudans for the loss of the Jooyun. Be thankful, pilot, that we no longer live in an era in which an incident such as this could ignite an all-out war between our species. The GTVA is strong, and we have moved beyond the misunderstandings of the past. However, the destruction of an allied ship under our protection is an embarrassment to the squadron. That this happened under your leadership should give you pause. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

949, "Keep a close watch on all your escort targets using the 'E' key, and don't let the fighters distract you.  The bombers must be your first priority. To take out turrets, the Harpoon missile is your best choice. The Hornet works best against fighters.  Make sure your missile has a clean line of sight. "

950, "Though our mission was overall a success, we lost the Parracombe. The destruction of a single freighter will not delay the deployment of the Colossus, but our squadron must accept responsibility for vessels lost on our watch. You're in a leadership position, pilot. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

The destruction of a single gas miner will not delay the deployment of the Colossus, but our squadron must accept responsibility for vessels lost on our watch. You're in a leadership position, pilot. Ask yourself what you could have done to avoid this outcome, and what you will do in the future to ensure it never happens again.

Our offensive against the NTF has achieved limited success. Only the Colossus has enough firepower to break this stalemate. If we fail, the Alliance will have no choice but to agree to Bosch's demands."

952, "The NTF decimated our supply convoys, forcing Command to withdraw the Colossus and postpone our offensive against Admiral Koth and the Repulse. Your convoy lost all three vessels, a dismal failure by any measure. 

The news from the captial in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous."

953, "Keep a close watch on all your escort targets using the 'E' key, and don't let the fighters distract you. Prioritize bombers, then fighters, then turrets.  When the Maelstrom appears, you have a limited amount of time before it is within beam range of the convoy.  Use the 'K' key to target turrets. To take out turrets, the Harpoon missile is your best choice. The Hornet works best against fighters. Make sure your missile has a clean line of sight. "

954, "The NTF decimated our supply convoys, with only a handful of freighters and gas miners surviving the well-orchestrated attack. Your convoy lost two out of three vessels, a failed outcome by any measure. 

The news from the capital in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous.
"

955, "The survival of the Jooyun may be good news for our Vasudan allies, but the loss of the Parracombe and the Avila are nothing less than catastrophic. 

The news from the capital in Beta Aquilae is not good. Support for a negotiated settlement is growing in the Security Council, even with the Colossus now operational. Opponents of the Colossus program denounce the project as a monstrosity prone to logistical failure. For Admiral Petrarch and the Aquitaine, this outcome could not be more disastrous."

956, "By clearing out the rebel sentry guns in the asteroid field, you have significantly reduced the danger posed to future convoys on this route. Your initiative may save many lives."

957, "You destroyed the Maelstrom but failed to neutralize its forward beam turret first. Had you followed orders, you would have reduced the damage inflicted upon the convoy vessels. Though you have been granted responsibility as a wing leader, this does not privilege you to ignore Command's directives. This incident will be noted in your record."

981, "That's wishful thinking, pilot. Proceed with caution, and stay close to the convoy."

982, "Command, a rebel sentry gun has activated one thousand meters from the convoy!"

983, "Destroy it, but be careful, Alpha. The NTF seem to have an ambush in the works. Keep an eye out for hostile fighters."

991, "Feint! Parry! Riposte!"

992, "The 242nd attacks two rebel cruisers and their escorts in an attempt to lure the NTD Repulse into position.
"

993, "The Alliance will now take the $f Colossus on the offensive. We intend to break the back of the rebel fleet in Epsilon Pegasi, and the 242nd will play a pivotal role. Rear Admiral Koth is somewhere in this system. He will not commit the $h Repulse unless it's absolutely necessary. Your job is to create that necessity. "

994, "To lure Koth into our trap, the first phase of the mission will involve an attack against the rebel cruisers $h Majestic and $h Refute. They are defended by a complement of twelve Hercules-class fighters. With the speed and agility of the Perseus, you should be able to outmaneuver the Hercs and take them down."

995, "Your primary objective will be to eliminate the fighter escort. This will pave the way for the $f GTC $f Rampart and our bomber wings, which will deliver the main thrust of the strike. Our plan is to damage the rebel cruisers while presenting the smallest credible threat. "

996, "If the rebels think our force consists of nothing more than a Leviathan and a few errant bombers, they may capitalize on this advantage and sortie their fleet. For this reason, the cruisers must not be destroyed before their reinforcements enter the field of engagement. "

997, "If Koth sends in the $h Repulse to finish the job, Command will deploy the $f Colossus to strike the final blow. Your secondary objective will be to defend the $f Rampart during this phase of the battle. The cruiser will probably sustain damage from the earlier exchange. Good luck, Alpha."

998, "The Alliance has declared a decisive victory in Epsilon Pegasi. With our blockade of the Polaris jump node, all rebel forces in the system have surrendered. In recognition of your contributions to the allied victory, you are hereby awarded the Epsilon Pegasi Liberation Medal. The GTVA Security Council and General Assembly extend their gratitude for your service.

Admiral Petrarch has requested recommendations for the 134th Barracuda squadron, a combat evaluation unit. I have forwarded your name as an outstanding candidate. The primary role of the 134th is the field testing of new technologies. In my estimation, you will excel in this challenging position.

However, I have also learned that Special Operations Command requires a volunteer for an extremely dangerous operation. If you choose to pursue this course, your assignment with the 134th will be waiting for you upon your return. The decision is yours, pilot."

999, "The Alliance has declared a decisive victory in Epsilon Pegasi. With our blockade of the Polaris jump node, all rebel forces in the system have surrendered. However, the 242nd Suicide Kings have little cause to celebrate. 

The destruction of the Rampart reflects poorly on our unit and on your leadership. Command relies on our intercept squadrons to defend our warships. As a wing leader, you must learn how to take initiative, how to evaluate a crisis, and how to manage your squadmates. 

I have recommended your immediate transfer to the 134th Barracudas, a combat evaluation unit. At least the consequences of failure in such a squadron are not so grim. I have also learned that Special Operations Command requires a volunteer for a suicide mission. Of course, that decision is entirely up to you. "

At 2150, the Colossus entered the Polaris system and neutralized the NTD Andronicus and the NTC Camisard, securing the jump node from Epsilon Pegasi. Meanwhile, the 13th Vasudan Battle Group has destroyed the NTD Cyrene and gained foothold in Sirius. Intelligence reports that Admiral Bosch and his elite guard have withdrawn to the rebel enclave of Regulus. 

Command anticipates a total allied victory in less than 30 days."

1035, "The Subspace Portal

Dr. Hargrove's task force has determined that the subspace portal in Gamma Draconis was constructed by the Ancients, an extinct civilization discovered near the end of the Great War. Artifacts excavated in the Altair system contained data that enabled the GTA and PVN to destroy the SD Lucifer. Many Terran and Vasudan systems once belonged to the Ancients' empire, which the Shivans obliterated eight thousand years ago. The portal has been renamed Knossos, after the Earth's Minoan civilization."

1036, "The Deneb Connection

Intelligence has learned that Bosch acquired Ancient materials from an excavation site in the Deneb system. These artifacts somehow enabled Bosch to locate and activate the Knossos portal. This explains the presence of the admiral's command ship in the Deneb asteroid belt. Bosch then sent the NTC Trinity into Gamma Draconis to activate the portal, which lured the Shivans into that system. 

We do not know Bosch's motives or what the Shivans are doing in the nebula."

1037, "Nostos

Allied scientists studying the portal remain optimistic about the potential for this technology. In five to ten years, we might be able to restore contact with Earth or create new jump nodes to unexplored regions of the galaxy. For this reason, the portal must remain open for as long as possible. 

Command has issued a standing order to destroy the device should a full-scale invasion be imminent."

1038, "Our Objectives

The destruction of the Ravana has intensified Shivan activity in the nebula. The Shivan fleet appears to be smaller than the armada we defeated three decades ago, and our improved technology gives us a tactical advantage. However, with the possibility of uncharted jump nodes leading to more Shivan-infested systems, we cannot know with any certainty the full extent of the enemy force. 

A miscalculation on our part could unleash the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1039, "New Technologies

The Aquitaine will spearhead the next phase of our exploration and containment operation in the nebula. To help us achieve our objectives, the Alliance has developed new technologies, including Advanced Warning And Control Systems, or AWACS, and gas mining vessels to gather deuterium for our fusion reactors. 

Prototypes of these new tactical weapons and fighters will be deployed pending successful completion of field tests. The 134th Barracudas will be conducting these combat exercises near the Gamma Draconis jump node."

1040, "GTW ML-70 Morning Star

Two next-generation weapons are now available: the Morning Star and the EMP missile. The GTW ML-70 Morning Star improves upon the Flail gun developed during the Great War. Recent advances in high-temperature optics enable the primary focusing chamber of the Morning Star to produce a more coherent charge. Though an energy weapon, the Morning Star has a powerful kinetic effect on its target."

1041, "EMP Missile

The EMP missile interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within the blast radius of the warhead. The detonation scrambles targeting data and jams communications. Tactically, the EMP is an effective anti-bomber weapon. It prevents these craft from acquiring aspect lock and temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight."

1042, "Welcome to the 134th Barracudas, pilot. I'm Commander Vincey, your squadron leader. The 134th is a combat evaluation unit, or CEU, which means we're among the first to test new ships and weapons in the field. While we carry out our missions, engineers will gather data on the systems we've been assigned to test."

1043, "In this mission, our primary objective is to escort two Triton-class freighters, the $f Erinpura and the $f Vauban. They will enter the nebula at the Gamma Draconis node and travel to their waypoint, where they will rendezvous with the $f GTCv $f Warspite. Their cargo is the new Target Acquisition and Guidance missile system. "

1044, "The $f GTA $f Lucidity will provide AWACS support for this mission. With its powerful sensor array, the $f Lucidity will transmit targeting data to your fighter, effectively increasing your sensor range. The 134th will be the first to test the system in the nebula."

1045, "Now keep in mind that the C in CEU stands for Combat. These aren't controlled laboratory experiments. Shivan activity has intensified, so you can expect to engage some $h Maras and $h Cains out there. If the action gets too intense, call in reinforcements at your discretion. Good luck, pilot."

1046, "Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation. As we speak, analysts are reviewing the data from our flight recorders. The entire squadron has been grounded pending the conclusion of this inquiry.

Command considers this deployment of the AWACS to be a total failure."

1047, "It is essential that you concentrate your efforts on enemy bombers. You also have reinforcements at your disposal. You would be well advised to make efficient use of them."

1048, "Though we lost a freighter in this engagement, the combat field test of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile will proceed on schedule. The 134th will be working with the Warspite to conduct this exercise. 

The destruction of the AWACS reveals a critical flaw. Though the AWACS improved our sensor capabilities, its vulnerability limits the potential of the craft in combat scenarios. On the other hand, your unit's failure to protect the AWACS indicates that more effective leadership may be required here."

Command rates the initial deployment of the AWACS a complete success. Our improved sensor capability gave us the tactical advantage we required to respond quickly and decisively to the Shivan attack. 

Prepare your wing for your next sortie, pilot. The TAG missile combat field test begins at 0315."

1051, "You have flown an excellent mission."

1052, "Our squadron lost the Erinpura, the Vauban, and the TAG missile prototypes. Not only will the TAG exercise be cancelled, but Command has also ordered a full investigation.

The Warspite will supervise this combined arms exercise."

1084, "The 134th will now assist with the combat evaluation of the Target Acquisition and Guidance missile. This will be the first deployment of this system in an actual combat exercise. Our laboratory simulations indicate it has significant potential as a tactical weapon. "

1085, "When you hit a target with the TAG warhead, the missile's beacon will illuminate the target for allied capital ships within range. All available firepower will be brought to bear for a quick resolution. This technology could be a decisive advantage for the $f GTVA. In this exercise, we will test the prototype TAG-A."

1086, "Command has deployed scout wings to Shivan positions. They will lure targets within range of our guns. Once the enemy approaches, get in behind the target quickly and launch your TAGs. Stay within 3000 meters of the corvette for maximum effectiveness. The $f Lucidity will provide AWACS coverage.  "

1089, "Though this exercise did not proceed as planned, the 134th met the challenge head-on and defended our warships admirably. 

Overall, this field deployment of the TAG missile exceeded our expectations. Research and Development is now working on improvements to the TAG-A prototype, including an aspect-seeking warhead and a more maneuverable projectile. These enhancements should make the TAG a versatile weapon for our tactical wings."

1090, "The destruction of the Warspite was a senseless tragedy. The lives of Captain Forsythe and his crew should not have been sacrificed for the sake of a prototype exercise. The 134th was called upon to get our warships out of a difficult situation, and we failed. As leader of Alpha wing, re-evaluate this scenario carefully. What could you have done to save the Warspite?"

1091, "You must make careful use of every TAG missile you are alotted.  Since they are unguided missiles you are advised to get as close to your target as possible.  Once an enemy is TAG'ed move clear quickly so you don't take friendly fire."

1108, "We are fully aware of your situation, Alpha.  We are also aware that thousands of lives on board the Warspite and Lucidity are counting on you."

1109, "Roger that, Command. We'll get the job done."

1110, "All clear. Mission complete. Alpha, you may return to base. "

1111, "A wing of five Taurvis now closing in! Intercept those bombers, Alpha!"

1112, "Iota wing here. Ready to assist."

1113, "We are fully aware of your situation, Alpha.  We are also aware of thousands of lives on board the Warspite that are counting on you."

1114, "This is the Warspite! We're under heavy fire! Alpha, unless you TAG those hostiles, we are completely defenseless!"

1115, "The Shivans have destroyed the Warspite!"

1116, "We need fighter cover on the Lucidity! We must not lose the AWACS!"

1117, "The Lucidity has been destroyed!"

1118, "Alpha, return to base on the double. This mission is over."

1119, "Mayday! Mayday! This is Kappa 3 of the 107th Ravens, GTD Aquitaine! Command, do you copy?"

1120, "Affirmative, Kappa 3! What's your status?"

1121, "Command, get the fleet out of the nebula! Shut down the portal now! There's no time to lose!"

1122, "I am transmitting the coordinates of the Aquitaine's current position. Return to base immediately. You are badly damaged."

1123, "Listen to me! There's no way we can stop them this time! Shut down the portal before it's too late! There's something out there, Command! Please! "

1124, "Kappa 3, do you copy? Please respond. I repeat. Do you copy?"

1125, "All units, you will disregard Kappa 3's transmission. The communication record of this sortie has been classified level Phi.  "

1127, "The 134th participates in a field exercise with the new Pegasus stealth fighter.
"

1128, "In this mission, the 134th will participate in a test of the new Pegasus-class stealth fighter, developed for allied operations in the nebula. The unusual design of the Pegasus minimizes the EM signature emitted by the fighter, making it all but impossible to detect with sensors. This exercise will be the first simulation of the Pegasus under combat conditions in the nebula environment."

1129, "Alpha wing, your objective is to defend the $f GTC $f Oberon, a decommissioned Fenris cruiser. The $f Oberon has served the Alliance since the Great War, and most of its systems have been stripped down to repair other cruisers in circulation. Flying the Pegasus prototypes, $h Delta wing will attack the $f Oberon. Your job is to repel their offensive."

1130, "Your weapons will be neutralized for the duration of the test. Though you may fire your lasers and missiles, they will inflict only superficial damage against $h Delta wing. Engineers on board the $f GTD $f Aquitaine will monitor the progress of the exercise and gather data to verify the stealth capability and combat potential of the Pegasus."

1131, "The Shivans destroyed the Aquitaine. Without this ship, our operations in the nebula are in jeopardy. Though we were outnumbered and outgunned, the Aquitaine went down on our watch. The 10,000 officers and crew who perished were our friends and comrades. The 134th is the disgrace of the allied fleet. 

Because we serve on the front lines, the brass think it's our duty to take the fall for their mistakes. As your squadron leader, I will testify on your behalf. More wings should have been deployed to cover the Aquitaine's retreat. However, until Command completes its inquiry, you will be stripped of your wings and held in custody. You are dismissed, pilot."

1132, "Bombers should be your highest priority when protecting the Aquitaine."

1133, "Well done, pilot. Outnumbered and outgunned, you covered the Aquitaine's retreat through the Gamma Draconis jump node.  The Moloch and its fighters inflicted severe damage, and repair crews are now working to get the destroyer back on line. Nevertheless, your actions saved thousands of lives.

The 64th Raptors are in need of bomber pilots. I've recommended that you be transferred. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

We have just received word that Bosch and his rebel fleet are en route to Gamma Draconis. We'll be redeployed ASAP to head them off. Admiral Petrarch will outline the details of our upcoming operation at 2150 hours."

1134, "Excellent work, pilot. Outnumbered and outgunned, you covered the Aquitaine's retreat through the Gamma Draconis jump node. For saving a capital ship of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance from imminent destruction, you are hereby awarded the Order of Galatea. Congratulations.

The 64th Raptors need a wing leader, and I think you are just the pilot for the job. Flying bombers is hard work, but with a bank of Cyclops torpedoes, you'll have the firepower to neutralize enemy corvettes and destroyers.

We have just received word that Bosch and his rebel fleet are en route to Gamma Draconis. We'll be redeployed ASAP to head them off. Admiral Petrarch will outline the details of our upcoming operation at 2150 hours."

1135, "You did not have authorization to return to base, pilot. Your actions compromized our combat evaluation of the Pegasus stealth fighter. You have been grounded until further notice."

1136, "In order to destroy the Moloch-class corvette, you must keep it within sensor range. You are providing sensor support for the Aquitaine."

1145, "This exercise will begin in 5...4...3...2...1. Delta wing, engage stealth mode."

1146, "Aquitaine, set course for the Gamma Draconis jump node. We're pulling you out of there."

1147, "Alpha has been deployed. Delta wing, are you ready?"

1148, "Affirmative, Command. Those Alpha scrubs won't even know what hit 'em."

1149, "Alpha, we are switching your weapons to training mode. Your guns and missiles will inflict superficial damage."

1150, "With all due respect, I recommend we use live ammo for this exercise, sir."

1151, "The Oberon has jumped in and is standing by. Your objective, Alpha, is to defend this cruiser against Delta wing's attack."

1152, "Let's take these flyboys out of circulation, Delta."

1153, "Gathering test data now. All systems are functioning normally."

1154, "Here they come!"

1155, "Stay on them Alpha. Don't lose visual contact!"

1156, "Target profile is razor thin. Hard to hit at medium range."

1157, "Alpha, can you target Delta wing?"

1158, "Negative, Command. Even at point blank range my sensors pick up nothing."

1159, "Good. How are you holding up, Delta?"

1160, "Shielding and armor have a low damage threshold."

1161, "Speed and maneuverability are well above average."

1162, "Limited offensive capability. An excellent reconnaissance fighter in my estimation."

1163, "Delta wing has inflicted moderate damage against the Oberon. Stay on them, Alpha. Don't lose them in the fog."

1164, "The Oberon has sustained heavy damage. The stealth fighters are getting the best of you, Alpha."

1165, "The Oberon's hull integrity has fallen below critical. Looks like a victory for Delta wing."

1166, "That's enough for the first test, pilots. Our engineers have gathered important data. Good work attacking the Fenris, Delta. You caught Alpha wing off guard."

1167, "Excellent work, pilots. Our engineers have gathered valuable data. Good work defending the Fenris, Alpha wing."

1168, "We will now begin the second test."

1169, "Abort the exercise! Repeat! Abort the exercise! Sensors are reading incoming hostiles! Delta wing, return to the Aquitaine on the double."

1170, "Alpha wing, your primary and secondary weapons have been rearmed. Hold off the Shivans as the Aquitaine withdraws."

1171, "Roger that, Command. Engaging fusion drives. Distance from the node is 4500 meters. We will reach our jump point in 6 minutes."

1172, "This is the Aquitaine. Shivan warheads have impacted our hull. We are sustaining heavy damage from the Moloch's main gun."

1173, "This is the Aquitaine. All hands prepare to abandon ship! Probability of hull failure is high!"

1174, "The Aquitaine has been destroyed! Abort mission, pilots! Get out of there now!"

1175, "The Aquitaine has reached the Gamma Draconis jump node! Secure the area and return to base, pilots. Well done."

1179, "The 64th Raptors lead a bombing action against NTF ships running the blockade of the Capella jump node.
"

1180, "Bosch's Gambit

We have received news of an alarming development on the civil war front. Massing his forces in the Regulus system, Admiral Bosch outmaneuvered the Colossus and its battle group. The rebel armada is now en route for the Gamma Draconis system, via Polaris, Epsilon Pegasi, and Capella. 

Their final destination: the Knossos subspace portal."

1181, "Running the Gauntlet

Allied forces destroyed a number of NTF warships as they ran our gauntlet of jump node blockades. However, the rebels have sufficient firepower to threaten our positions in Gamma Draconis. 

The Colossus and its battle group are in close pursuit, neutralizing enemy stragglers. We must hold Gamma Draconis until these reinforcements arrive."

1182, "On the Barricades

Our squadrons will assist with the blockade of the Capella node. As the rebels begin their incursion, our objective will be to inflict as much damage as possible. The second phase will involve a counterstrike against enemy rallying positions, where the rebels will gather to coordinate their final attack. 

We must diminish the NTF's offensive capability before our confrontation at the node."

1183, "Rebellion's End

This campaign may prove to be the admiral's final gambit. Whether or not Bosch reaches the portal, the NTF regime and its domination of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius are effectively over. Command has disclosed neither the motives behind Bosch's actions nor the consequences should the admiral succeed. 

We do know that 18 months of carnage and terror will soon come to an end."

1184, "Artemis Bomber

The Aquitaine has just received four wings of the new GTB Artemis, the Alliance's next-generation light bomber. The most agile ship of its class, the Artemis will carry the Cyclops torpedo, our modified anti-cruiser warhead. I have reassigned pilots to the 64th Raptors. This squadron will play a bomber and heavy assault role in the upcoming operation."

1185, "Prometheus S

The Artemis will be armed with the new Prometheus cannon. Our nebula gas miners have gathered sufficient resources to resume production of the GTW-5 Prometheus S. The S-type is based on the original design of the Prometheus cannon. With high marks for shield and hull damage, the Prometheus was our weapon of choice in the Great War."

1186, "This is Commander Beckett, leader of the 64th Raptors Bomber Squadron. At 0457, NTF warships entered the Gamma Draconis system and engaged our blockade. So far we've taken down the NTC Absalon, the NTC Cunaxa, and several troop transports.  Admiral Petrarch has called in the 64th to assist."

1187, "The Vasudans are leading the blockade with the $f GVD $f Hedetet, a Typhon-class destroyer. The Alliance has also set up a network of five $f Mjolnir RBCs, or Remote Beam Cannons. These unmanned experimental weapon platforms discharge anti-warship beams to complement the defense of a strategic target."

1188, "The $h NTF fleet will enter through the Capella jump node. Each warship will then jump to a rallying point within the Gamma Draconis system. In the interval between jumps, they will re-energize their subspace drives. Your role will be to neutralize the warships with your Cyclops torpedoes."

1189, "The $h Iceni has already slipped through our defenses, but we will make every effort to track Bosch down before the rebels rally their forces and attack. According to Intelligence, the $h NTD $h Uhuru, the $h NTC $h Pax, the $h NTC $h Liberty, and the $h NTC $h Undaunted have entered the subspace node and are heading for the blockade."

1190, "The 64th Raptors are the disgrace of the Aquitaine and the GTVA. Every warship that ran our blockade threatens our positions in the Gamma Draconis system. Though we have the strength to crush the rebellion, our failure here will cost lives and resources we should not have to sacrifice.  

Admiral Petrarch has grounded the 64th until further notice. Our bombers will be reassigned to the 107th Ravens. Dismissed, pilot."

1191, "Coordinate your squadmates to attack the critical targets."

1192, "Excellent work, pilot. With our blockade of the Capella jump node, the Alliance has achieved a major victory. The Mjolnir RBCs and the bombing action of the 64th negated a significant component of the rebel fleet. The Raptors neutralized all hostile warships that crossed our lines. No other squadron can make that claim.

Our unit will be redeployed ASAP. Report to the ready room on the double."

1193, "Good work, pilot. The Mjolnir RBCs and the bombing action of the 64th reduced the offensive capability of the NTF fleet. Our chances of minimizing allied casualties in Gamma Draconis have improved significantly.

1203, "Good work, pilots! Don't smoke 'em yet. We've got more trouble on the way."

1204, "The NTD Uhuru has jumped! Now en route to rallying position."

1205, "Alpha 1, a Deimos-class corvette, the NTCv Pax, has entered the system."

1206, "The Pax is going down!"

1207, "The Pax has escaped! This is a blockade, pilots! We've got to shut the rebels down!"

1208, "The NTC Liberty now entering the system. Aeolus-class cruiser. Evade the Loki escort, Alpha!"

1209, "That's a confirmed kill! We've got more hostiles jumping in!"

1210, "Heads up, Alpha! The NTC Undaunted, a Leviathan-class cruiser, has entered the fray."

1211, "Stay focused, Alpha. The battle's not over yet."

1212, "The Undaunted has jumped out. Every ship that gets away means trouble later, pilots!"

1215, "Inspiration objective neutralized! Stand clear of the blast!"

1216, "The Inspiration has run the blockade!"

1217, "The NTCv Perseverance has cleared the node!"

1218, "The Perseverance is no more! That's what you flyboys get paid for!"

1219, "The Perseverance has made the jump. That's gonna cost us big, pilots."

"

1223, "Reconnaissance has located one of the $h NTF's rallying points within the Gamma Draconis system. The rebels are preparing to execute a coordinated strike to acquire control of the Knossos subspace portal. Intelligence believes the $h NTF has sufficient firepower to mount a credible offensive."

1224, "Your primary target is the $h Iceni, Bosch's command ship. The 64th Raptors will lead the strike. The Vasudans will sortie the $f GVC $f Hyksos and a wing of Serapis fighters to assist. We will deploy additional forces as they become available."

1225, "You are now authorized to carry the GTM-10 Piranhas. A third-generation version of the Synaptic bomb, the Piranha provides a high-explosive anti-fighter screen. Trigger the Piranha's detonation by pressing your launch button a second time."

1226, "You faced down fierce resistance and damaged the rebel fleet. The NTF has commenced its attack on the Knossos subspace portal, but the efforts of our squadron have significantly reduced their offensive capability. Our strikes against the other rebel rallying points also achieved major victories, though Admiral Bosch remains at large. This is the beginning of the end for the NTF."

1227, "Our inability to inflict significant damage against the rebel warships may compromise our defense of the Knossos subspace portal. Our strikes against the other rebel rallying points also failed to achieve decisive results. Though the Neo-Terran Front remains on the brink of collapse, we cannot afford to underestimate Bosch and his followers."

1228, "Coordinate your efforts with your squadmates. Keep them focused on critical targets."

1229, "We mourn the loss of our ships and crew. Many lives were lost in this battle that perhaps could have been saved had we been more vigilant. We will defeat Bosch and the Neo-Terran Front, but this victory should not come at such a high price. The end of the civil war does not mean peace for the Alliance. We have the Shivans to contend with, and for that battle, we will need every warship in the armada."

1230, "Use your squadmates to protect friendly craft."

1231, "Command is pleased we have succeeded in minimizing allied casualties throughout this operation. We will defeat Bosch and the Neo-Terran Front, though a victory in the civil war does not mean peace for the Alliance. We still have the Shivans to contend with, and for that battle, we will need every warship in the armada."

1240, "What's the situation, Beta?"

1241, "Either recon screwed up or Bosch jumped already."

1242, "Should we abort our attack, Command?"

1243, "Recon will track down the Iceni. Keep an eye out in case Bosch jumps in from another rallying point."

1247, "Negative, pilots. Destroy the Vindicator. Neutralize any rebel ship that reaches the rallying point. We'll intercept Bosch at the portal."

1248, "Command, we need more firepower here!"

1249, "We are deploying Delta wing and the GTC Diomedes to assist. Please stand by."

1250, "This is the Diomedes. Engaging the rebels now."

1260, "Endgame"

1261, "The 64th must intercept a rebel attack at the Knossos subspace portal."

1262, "The $h NTF has attacked our warships defending the Knossos. We repelled their first offensive, but the $h NTC $h Alexandria reached the portal and made the jump into the nebula. We believe the rebels are regrouping to launch a second assault. Command has positioned the $f GTA $f Monitor to hold off the attack, and reinforcements are on their way."

1263, "The 64th will play a fighter role in this mission. The $h NTF have a few Zeus and Medusa wings remaining, so your objective will be to engage all rebel bombers and neutralize their fighter escort. The $f Colossus has engaged the $h NTC $h Vanguard and the $h NTCv $h Congreve. We will move the $f Colossus into position as soon as this battle has been resolved."

1264, "Keep an eye out for the $h NTF $h Iceni. If this vessel emerges within range, you are authorized to engage and destroy it. Bosch has eluded our forces since he entered the Gamma Draconis system. Though we anticipate Bosch will either attempt to gain control of the Knossos or enter the portal itself, be prepared for any development."

1265, "This is the endgame, pilot. Bosch's $h Neo-Terran $h Front has been crushed.  Only the die-hard fanatics remain. They'll fight to the death and take as many of us with them as they can. We have every confidence in your ability to get the job done. Good luck."

1266, "The Aquitaine now has available the GTM-4a Tornado, a modified version of the Hornet missile. With improved fire control systems and guidance computers, the Tornado can fire more often and with greater accuracy than the Hornet. Be advised the Tornado will fail to arm its ordnance properly if aspect lock has not been achieved."

1267, "You are also authorized to carry the new GTM-11 Infyrno, a wide-area fighter suppression warhead. The Infyrno is a remote detonation missile. Hit your secondary trigger a second time to detonate. A HUD indicator will display the warhead's distance.  The Infyrno will release multiple submunitions with ultra-high explosive charges."

1268, "The Alliance charged the 64th Raptors with the duty of defending the Monitor, the Fortune, and the thousands of lives on board these warships. We failed our mission. Though these officers and crew sacrificed their lives for the GTVA, there is no hero's welcome for our squadron. Our job was to get these men and women home alive.

I am recommending your immediate transfer out of this unit. The Admiral and I believe you might be better suited to pilot a support ship, a freighter, or maybe a transport. A tactical squadron is no place for officers who cannot get the job done. There's too much at stake here."

1269, "Bombers should be your highest priority."

1270, "The Alliance mourns the loss of the GTC Monitor. Thousands of courageous officers and crew sacrificed their lives for the GTVA. We as a squadron must ask ourselves what could have been done to avert this tragedy.

Aken Bosch has eluded capture once again. Jumping in near the Knossos was a risky maneuver, but it enabled him to reach the nebula. Rebel saboteurs on board the Colossus temporarily shut down fire control to give the Iceni a window of opportunity. These operatives are now in custody.

You have been reassigned. Admiral Petrarch has requested recommendations for pilots to participate in an officer exchange program with the Vasudans. The Admiral and I believe a tour of duty with Vasudan Tactical Command may do you some good."

This is Admiral Khafre, commanding officer of the GVD Psamtik, 13th Vasudan Battle Group.

The NTF rebellion is over. Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius are now under allied control, and we begin the process of rebuilding these systems after 18 months of bloodshed. NTF officers responsible for the genocide of Vasudan civilians will face a war crimes tribunal in Beta Aquilae. GTVA warships in the nebula are now hunting down the Iceni and the other blockade runners."

1309, "Welcome, Terrans

For those Terran pilots joining us in Gamma Draconis, welcome aboard. Your reassignment is part of an officer exchange program to foster better cooperation and understanding. You will serve in Vasudan wings and pilot Vasudan fighters. Our crews have modified our craft to accommodate Terran pilots.

We as an alliance have come a long way since the Terran-Vasudan War, and initiatives such as this can only strengthen the bond between our species."

1310, "The Second Front

With the rebellion defeated, we are now able to focus on our exploration and containment operation in the nebula.

We begin launching our squadrons at 3230, Vasudan Galactic Time."

The Psamtik has received a shipment of the new GTW-66 Maxim Gun.

You have also been issued the GTW-83 Lamprey Cannon. A second-generation Leech gun, the Lamprey affects the energy systems of your target, draining its weapon, shield, and afterburner reserves. Coupled with a balanced hull and shield damaging weapon, the Lamprey is highly effective against smaller vessels."

1313, "Mekhu HL-7

All Terrans be advised that Vasudan fighters and bombers may be equipped with the Mekhu HL-7. A modified version of the Subach HL-7, the Mekhu design has been optimized for the reactor grids of Vasudan craft to increase the cannon's rate of fire."

1314, "Welcome to the 203rd, Terran. I am Commander Habu, squadron leader. Our unit has served the Emperor since the war between our species, nearly five decades ago. I understand you were among the pilots who assisted our counter-insurgency effort in the Deneb system. We are honored to fight by your side, pilot. You will lead Alpha wing."

1315, "Allied Command has ordered the 203rd to nullify a gas mining operation in the vicinity of our secured perimeter. Reconnaissance has located six $h Rahu-class miners, defended by a screen of sentry guns. Your primary objective is to destroy the miners. Your secondary objective is to neutralize the sentry guns."

1316, "Be advised the shockwave of a gas miner explosion will have a destructive radius greater than that of a ship of comparable size. As the hull integrity of your target approaches zero, put as much distance as possible between yourself and the miner. We believe the Shivans are using the nebular gas for energy. Good luck."

1317, "Allied Intelligence has no conclusive data on the Sathanas, the Shivan juggernaut that destroyed the Tatenen. The GTVA Security Council has declared a state of emergency.

If our preliminary assessment is correct, the Shivans are preparing a full-scale incursion. However, the Sathanas could pose a much greater threat than the Lucifer superdestroyer of the Great War. Our priority must be to gather as much data as possible. Meanwhile, Command is preparing to execute a contingency plan should the Shivans move this vessel into Gamma Draconis.

You performed well in this mission, Terran. Though we damaged their gas-mining operation, we now have greater concerns to attend to."

1318, "A Vasudan never leaves the field of battle without authorization from a superior officer. Your cowardice jeopardized the lives of our brothers and sisters. You are hereby stripped of your wings and all privileges bestowed upon you as an officer of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance. You will be taken into custody and handed over to the Terran 3rd Battle Group authority, where you will face a court martial. You are a disgrace to your species, Terran."

1319, "Allied Intelligence has no conclusive data on the Sathanas, the Shivan juggernaut that destroyed the Tatenen. The GTVA Security Council has declared a state of emergency.

If our preliminary assessment is correct, the Shivans are preparing a full-scale incursion. However, the Sathanas could pose a much greater threat than the Lucifer superdestroyer of the Great War. Our priority must be to gather as much data as possible. Meanwhile, Command is preparing to execute a contingency plan should the Shivans move this vessel into Gamma Draconis.

Your valor and skill are formidable, Terran. Your commanders spoke very highly of you, and we see now their praise was not exaggerated. You risked your life above and beyond the call of duty to fulfill your objectives, regardless of the danger.  We'll make a Vasudan of you yet."

1325, "All units, return to base! We do not have the firepower to challenge that warship!"

1326, "Attention, all units. Long-range scanners detect a defensive perimeter of six sentry guns and a wing of Mara-class fighters, designation Virgo. Proceed with caution."

1333, "This is the Tatenen. Shivan bombers have engaged! Request immediate fighter cover!"

1334, "Good work, pilot. Their operation has been compromised fifty percent. Continue with your mission."

1335, "The GVA Junit will provide AWACS support."

1336, "One Belial-class sentry gun neutralized. Five more guard the perimeter."

1337, "We have negated three of six guns in the perimeter."

1338, "Perimeter objective neutralized. All guns are down."

1339, "We have destroyed one Rahu-class miner. Five remain. Seek and destroy."

1340, "Disengage now, Tatenen! Break off and retreat! We're pulling you out!"

1341, "All units, defend the Tatenen! We'll resume our attack once we eliminate this threat. Intercept and destroy!"

1342, "All units, we are picking up an unusual jump signature in your immediate vicinity.  Seek and identify."

1343, "A Monster in the Mist"

1344, "Flying the Ptah stealth fighter, Alpha 1 of the 203rd must scan the subsystems of the Sathanas.
"

1345, "Alpha 1, you will pilot the new Ptah-class stealth fighter. Your mission is to scan the subsystems of the $h Sathanas Juggernaut. Allied Intelligence has requested data regarding the navigation, weapons, sensors, and communications subsystems of the warship."

1346, "To scan a subsystem, you must first select it with the subsystem targeting control. Then close to 150 meters to scan. The lead indicator must be in the center of your reticle. Maintain that position until the scan indicator has moved across your target view. Average scanning time is five seconds."

1347, "The design of the stealth fighter will minimize your EM signature, though we have not tested the stealth fighter against Shivan targets. Avoid flying into the line of sight of enemy fighters, and keep moving as much as possible. The longer you stay in one position, the greater your risk of detection. Firing weapons will also reveal your position."

1348, "To create a diversion, the $f GVCv $f Maahes will direct an assault toward the stern of the warship. This will draw enemy fire away from you and the systems you must target. The $h Sathanas has a smaller concentration of turrets in this quadrant, but you must complete your mission quickly. The corvette will not last long against the Juggernaut."

1349, "Very impressive, Terran. Though Vasudan Tactical Command had its doubts, our deployment of the Ptah-class stealth fighter was successful. Against difficult odds, you acquired subsystem scans of the Shivan Juggernaut. 

GTVI analysts are now reviewing the data, searching for a weakness in the Juggernaut's defenses. Once Intelligence completes its report, Allied Command will outline our strategy for neutralizing the Sathanas threat."

1350, "The operation did not proceed as smoothly as we had anticipated. However, you survived a difficult engagement and scanned 3 of the 4 subsystems. Though we are lacking 25% of the requested data, our analysts assure us your performance was satisfactory, under the circumstances. Perhaps a Vasudan pilot would have been more successful, given the unusual design of our stealth fighter."

1351, "The mission did not proceed as smoothly as we planned. With data acquired for only 2 of the 4 subsystems, our analysts lack sufficient information to devise a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1352, "This mission was a complete failure. With data acquired for only 1 of the 4 subsystems, our analysts lack sufficient information to devise a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1353, "This mission was a disaster, pilot. You failed to scan any of the Juggernaut's subsystems, and our analysts have no information to plan a viable attack. We have no choice but to attempt the operation a second time.

Rest assured, you will not be selected to pilot the Ptah fighter. Vasudan Tactical Command has expressed its disappointment with your performance. Your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated. For the sake of the Alliance, let us hope a Vasudan pilot will have greater success."

1354, "The Sathanas vaporized the Maahes, killing all on board. Perhaps if you had completed your objectives in a more timely fashion, this tragedy might have been averted. Of course, Command must accept its share of the blame for failing to assess the status of the engagement."

1355, "Your attack against the turrets of the Sathanas has yielded important data regarding the relative strength of the Juggernaut's weapons. This information should prove useful."

1356, "For conspicuous gallantry at the risk of your own life, you are hereby awarded the Medal of Valor."

1366, "The subsystem's lead indicator must also be in your reticle. The average scanning time is five seconds. If the scan cycle is aborted, you will have to make another attempt."

1367, "The Maahes has already engaged the Sathanas. You'll have to move quickly."

1368, "This is the Maahes. We have sustained damage from the juggernaut's cannons. We cannot distract the Shivan force indefinitely."

1369, "Hang in there, Maahes. We need more time. Alpha 1, let's get a move on!"

1370, "Command, this is the Maahes. Our hull cannot withstand another salvo. We must withdraw immediately."

1371, "Acknowledged, Maahes. We're pulling you out. Alpha 1, you're on your own."

1380, "Excellent. One last subsystem to scan."

1381, "Mission accomplished, Alpha 1."

1382, "You may return to base, or you may perform one more task."

1383, "Destroy as many turrets as you can. Intelligence has requested data on the strength of the warship's armaments."

1384, "However, be advised you may return to base at any time."

1385, "The Sathanas has departed. Return to base, pilot."

1386, "Speaking in Tongues"

1387, "The 203rd attacks a Shivan warship in an attempt to lure the Sathanas into position."

1388, "Your reconnaissance of the $h Sathanas identified weak points in the Juggernaut's defenses. However, exploiting these weaknesses will require firepower that can be provided only by the main guns of our capital ships. The $f GVD $f Psamtik, the $f GTD $f Aquitaine, and the $f GVD $f Toeris are standing by. Your mission is to lure the $h Sathanas into position."

1389, "In the first phase, you will attack the $h SC $h Rephaim, a Rakshasa-class warship. Our recon flights have located the $h Rephaim near the allied secure zone. The cruiser is accompanied by two wings comprised of Mara-class fighters. Our analysis of the $h Rephaim's flight pattern suggests the vessel is patrolling the region."

1390, "Your first task is to eliminate the fighter escort. This must be achieved quickly, before reinforcements arrive. Once the escort has been neutralized, call in Delta wing. The bombers will help you destroy the $h Rephaim. If necessary, your wing will need to incapacitate the cruiser's beam turrets to clear a path for your bombers."

1391, "We anticipate the attack on the $h Rephaim will bring Shivan reinforcements.  Your squadron is charged with the duty of engaging and destroying these hostiles until the $h Sathanas arrives. Sigma wing will also be available to assist, once these bombers have returned from their current sortie."

1392, "The upgraded Target Acquisition and Guidance warhead is now available. The TAG-B, an aspect-seeking missile, features an improved shock-resistant substrate that enables the beacon to transmit data with greater precision.  The $f GVCv $f Sopedu will provide fire support for this operation."

1393, "The Alliance will execute simultaneous, coordinated strikes against Shivan positions in the nebula. For this reason, our destroyers will not be deployed unless the $h Sathanas appears in your field of engagement.  If we fail to lure the $h Sathanas, or if the Juggernaut engages our forces elsewhere, we will abort this mission."

1394, "At 0745 hours, reconnaissance sighted the Sathanas juggernaut heading for the jump node to Terran-Vasudan space. Because of the immediate risk to our home systems, Command has aborted the plan to attack the juggernaut in the nebula. All allied forces have been ordered to withdraw immediately to Gamma Draconis. Further orders will be issued upon our arrival. We have no conclusive data regarding the transmissions exchanged between the Iceni and the Rephaim."

1405, "That's impossible! This is an allied channel!"

1406, "Confirmed. We are receiving a transmission from the Shivan warship!"

1407, "Command, I have targeted the Iceni! The rebel command ship is in the field of engagement."

1408, "All units, engage the Shivans! Stand clear of the Iceni! Do not attack that ship!"

1409, "Acknowledged, Command. We will not engage the Iceni."

1410, "The Iceni has activated its subspace drive!"

1411, "Now deploying the Thutmose!"

1412, "We have destroyed the Rephaim! Excellent work, pilots."

1420, "Shivan reinforcements could arrive at any time. Rearm if you need to, pilots."

1421, "No sign of the Sathanas! We must keep up this offensive to lure the Shivan juggernaut!"

1422, "Delta wing is standing by. Call in the bombers at your discretion, Alpha."

1423, "Sigma wing is now standing by. Deploy these bombers at your discretion."

1424, "All units! Return to base! The Shivan juggernaut is heading for the Gamma Draconis node!"

1425, "Alpha 1, you are disobeying a direct order! Command is withdrawing the fleet to Gamma Draconis. If you do not jump out now, you'll be left behind."

1426, "You'll pay for your insubordination, pilot. Allied Command, out."

1427, "A Flaming Sword"

1428, "As a last resort, the GTVA demolishes the Knossos subspace device in Gamma Draconis.
"

1429, "Sathanas

The Shivan juggernaut Sathanas is now en route to the jump node leading to Terran-Vasudan space. Command ordered all units to rally in Gamma Draconis in three hours' time. Though we have accounted for most of our fleet, at least six warships have failed to reach the rendezvous point. We can wait for them no longer.  The GTVA Security Council has authorized the immediate destruction of the Knossos subspace portal."

1430, "Meson Bomb

To demolish the Knossos portal, we will detonate the meson bomb, an experimental new weapon under development at the Hideki Institute in the Vega system. Though its specifications are highly classifed, physicists claim the meson bomb has more explosive power than any other warhead in our arsenal, sufficient to destroy any small craft within a three-kilometer radius. The size of the bomb prohibits tactical deployment."

1431, "Allied Strategy

A small task force will oversee the demolition of the Knossos while the bulk of the allied fleet blockades the jump node leading to the densely-populated Capella system. Command has begun the process of evacuating the two hundred fifty million civilians inhabiting Capella, the largest exodus since the Great War. The Colossus will remain in that system to engage the Sathanas should we fail."

1432, "At 2230 hours, the $f GTVA announced its plan for the destruction of the Knossos device. For strategic and scientific reasons, we will not attack the portal with the main guns of our warships. The demolition of the subspace portal will be accomplished with the use of the experimental Meson bomb."

1433, "Our first objective will be to sanitize the area. Observers report that Shivan scouting wings have already entered Gamma Draconis, and enemy activity will intensify before the arrival of the $h Sathanas Juggernaut. The $f Renenet, a Sobek-class corvette, will monitor the operation and provide fire support."

1434, "Once we have eliminated the enemy presence, a freighter carrying the Meson warhead will deposit the bomb at the detonation site. This is the first deployment of the weapon prototype. Because computer simulations predict only a forty percent chance of success, we have two more warheads standing by."

1435, "We demolished the portal but to no avail.  The subspace vortex generated by the Knossos device has stabilized, and the Sathanas entered the Gamma Draconis system. Our forces are standing by to intercept the juggernaut at the Capella jump node.

We do not know how long the nebula jump node will remain open. In theory, it could be centuries before it collapses again. Scientists assure us that we have gathered sufficient data to reconstruct the Knossos, but a project of that magnitude would take decades to complete.
"

1436, "We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board. Under the circumstances, there was nothing you could have done to avert this catastrophe."

1437, "Nevertheless, your tenacity is impressive. You eliminated all Shivan fighters. You are a credit to your species. Vasudan Tactical Command has taken note of your performance."

1438, "The destruction of the freighter was unacceptable, Terran. You have sufficient combat experience to understand that freighters and transports are vulnerable targets, and they require fighter support in hostile environments. In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

1439, "It is not enough to attack targets of opportunity.  You must single out those that threaten your objectives and deal with them, either through direct action or by ordering your squadmates to do so."

1440, "We mourn the loss of the GVCv Renenet, its crew and the scientists on board.  In an operation such as this, when millions of lives are at stake, we cannot afford the luxury of error. Better situational awareness on your part would have yielded a more satisfactory resolution."

1449, "There's no time to wait. Alpha, close in and draw the fighters away from the Knossos. Lure them toward the Renenet. We need to clear that detonation site before we sortie the freighter. "

1450, "Acknowledged. We will lure them within range of the corvette's guns."

1451, "Command, we have engaged the enemy. We are now heading back to the Renenet."

1452, "Command, we achieved a clean detonation of the meson warhead. However, the Knossos portal remains fully operational. "

1453, "We will proceed with the second deployment. Demolition pattern sigma. We will use the remaining meson bombs for this attempt. The Sathanas juggernaut cannot be far away. "

1473, "The meson bomb is a joint development, Alpha 4. We are full partners in this enterprise."

1474, "Alpha wing, you would be well advised to concern yourself with the Shivans and leave these matters to the Security Council."

1475, "The Shivans have accepted your challenge, Alpha wing. Head back to the Renenet. Our turrets will open fire when the enemy comes within range."

1476, "Initiating detonation sequence. All units, stand clear of the blast zone."

1482, "Command, demolition pattern sigma has proven successful. The Knossos subspace portal has been destroyed."

1483, "Congratulations, Renenet. You just saved millions of lives out there. You'll get a hero's welcome back at the fleet. "

1484, "With all due respect, Command. This is no time for celebration. The destruction of this ancient artifact is an immeasurable loss. "

1485, "Our scientists have all the data we need to rebuild the portal in the future, Renenet. We just stopped the second Shivan invasion of our home systems."

1486, "Command, I'm picking up an incoming jump signature! The Sathanas is entering the system!"

1487, "That's impossible! Request immediate status update!"

1488, "The jump node between Gamma Draconis and the nebula has stabilized. Our destruction of the Knossos had no effect."

You will be armed with the new long-range Trebuchet missile and the Helios torpedo, the $f GTVA's most powerful tactical warhead."

1497, "Your wing destroyed the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. The tactical significance of this achievement cannot be over-emphasized. Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus. "

1498, "Your performance was outstanding."

1499, "Your wing destroyed three of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Under these circumstances, your performance is superb. Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus."

1501, "Your wing destroyed two of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons. Under these circumstances, your performance is adequate.  Initial reports from Capella are favorable, though the battle is far from over. You will be scrambled immediately to assist the Colossus."

1502, "You have performed well. The Helios is best used as a dive bomb. Because it travels at a low velocity, always launch it while moving at top speed."

1503, "You destroyed only one of the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons, pilot. You faced overwhelming odds, but they were not insurmountable. The Sathanas poses a dire threat, not only to the Colossus but to all systems of the GTVA. We are on the threshold of a second Shivan invasion, and we have limited resources to wage this war. "

1504, "The Helios is best used as a dive bomb. Because it travels at a low velocity, always launch it while moving at top speed."

1534, "Neither will the Colossus if you fail your mission! You have your orders! Do it now!"

1535, "Delta wing, disable the forward flak guns or we'll be ripped to shreds. Alpha, focus on the main cannons."

1536, "Acknowledged. Targeting flak guns now."

1537, "Well done, Alpha. The Thebes will be in system momentarily to secure the node. Rearm and repair quickly. More enemy warships are inbound. Gamma wing deployed."

1538, "The Shivans will attempt to consolidate their gains in Gamma Draconis. We must hold them off at all costs. Failure is not an option here."

1539, "This is the Thebes. We have emerged within a large debris field, Command. "

1540, "Alpha wing just resolved a tactical engagement, Thebes. Recon has sited a Demon-class destroyer, designation Beleth. The warship will be upon us momentarily."

1541, "Alpha and Gamma, you will be tasked with destroying the Demon's beam cannons. The Thebes will provide fire support. Reinforcements are standing by."

1542, "A Demon-class destroyer has jumped in. Command is well-informed."

1543, "Then they must know this mission is suicide."

1544, "Your performance was less than satisfactory, pilot. The Thebes will be in system momentarily to secure the node. Rearm and repair quickly. More enemy warships are inbound. Gamma wing deployed."

1545, "Excellent work, pilots. We have destroyed the Beleth. Secure the area and return to base. We need you in the Capella system."

1546, "Excellent work, pilots. Return to base pronto. We need you in the Capella system."

1547, "Good work."

1548, "Return to base, pilots. We need you to assist the Colossus in the Capella system."

1549, "The Phoenicia will hold back the Sathanas until you complete your objectives."

1550, "We have neutralized the first beam cannon!"

1551, "Good work. The Demon has only one beam turret operational."

1552, "We've destroyed the last of the main guns. Excellent job. Concentrate now on the anti-fighter beams and flak cannons."

1553, "The Sathanas is engaging its subspace drives. All units, get out of the way now!"

1554, "You failed this mission, pilot. The Sathanas will be at full strength when it confronts the Colossus. "

1555, "The Beleth has entered the Capella system! We have a massacre on our hands, pilot! Your incompetence has endangered millions of innocent lives! Return to base!"

1556, "The forward flak cannons are down. Good work."

1557, "The Beleth is engaging its jump drive! All units, stand clear!"

1558, "High Noon"

1559, "The Colossus and the Sathanas face off in the Capella system.
"

1560, "The $h Satahanas entered the Capella system and obliterated the line of defense we had established to intercept it. We now have no choice but to send in the $f Colossus. With its beam cannons still operational, the $h Sathanas has sufficient firepower to win this engagement.

Your wing will be scrambled immediately. There is no time to select your ship or armaments. Your mission is to neutralize these remaining beam cannons as quickly as possible. If you fail, we risk losing the $f Colossus and the Capella system. "

1561, "The $h Satahanas has entered the Capella system and engaged the $f Colossus. Your exceptional performance in Gamma Draconis has significantly improved the odds for the Alliance. We are deploying your wing to provide bomber support for the $f Colossus. Eliminate any target of opportunity, but do not take unnecessary risks."

1562, "With the destruction of the SJ Sathanas, Allied Command has declared a decisive victory. In the months ahead, we will isolate and eradicate the remnants of the Shivan fleet. This operation could not have succeeded without your intervention, pilot. By neutralizing the forward beam cannons of the Sathanas, you gave the Colossus the advantage it required to win the battle.

For your outstanding record of service, you are hereby awarded the Nebula Campaign Victory Star. This medal recognizes your contributions to our mission of exploration and containment, from your first engagement in Gamma Draconis to our victory in the Capella system. Most notably, we commend you for three successful sorties against the Shivan Juggernaut Sathanas. Congratulations, Terran."

1563, "With the destruction of the SJ Sathanas, Allied Command has declared a decisive victory. In the months ahead, we will isolate and eradicate the remnants of the Shivan fleet. The outcome of this operation would have been more favorable had you completed your objectives. Though the Colossus won the engagement, neutralizing the Juggernaut's forward beam cannons would have reduced the damage it sustained. "

1564, "The GTVA Colossus, the largest Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, over twenty years in the making, has been destroyed. Thirty thousand perished in the Juggernaut's attack, and millions more are in jeopardy. Though you neutralized the four beam cannons, you completed your objectives too late. "

1565, "The GTVA Colossus, the largest Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, over twenty years in the making, has been destroyed. Thirty thousand perished in the Juggernaut's attack, and millions more are in jeopardy. You failed to neutralize the forward beam cannons, pilot, and now we will all pay the price of that failure."

1571, "Help the Colossus neutralize the Sathanas"

1572, "Well done, secure the area and our work here will finished."

1573, "Colossus here. We have sustained moderate damage. Hull breach on forward decks 140 through 200. Damage control reports auxiliary systems compromised."

1574, "Command, this is the Colossus. Hull integrity dropping. Multiple systems approaching critical. Casualty rate escalating."

1575, "Colossus here! Our hull will not sustain another salvo! We must withdraw immediately, Command!"

1576, "We've lost the Colossus! Abort mission, Alpha. Return to base. "

1577, "You have two forward beam cannons to neutralize. Acquire your target and engage!"

1578, "You have only one forward beam cannon to neutralize. Acquire your target and engage!"

1579, "Listen up, Alpha. Eliminate targets of opportunity, but be careful. It's all up to the Colossus now."

1580, "The Sathanas is going down! All units, stand clear!"

1581, "Colossus, the Juggernaut has sustained only moderate damage. You need to direct more energy through your main guns!"

1582, "We're having difficulty stabilizing the power grid, Command. Shutting down non-essential systems."

1583, "More firepower, Colossus! The hull integrity of the Sathanas has fallen below fifty percent. "

1584, "Heat sinks were not made for this kind of abuse, Command! We'll melt down our cannons if we push any harder."

1585, "We're almost there, Colossus! Target has gone critical! The war must end here and now!"

1586, "Secondary and Tertiary reactors are down! Fire control is on the verge of redline! We're giving it all we got!"

1587, "One cannon left! We are running out of time, Alpha! "

1588, "All cannons are down! Repeat! All cannons are down!  Eliminate targets of opportunity, but be careful. It's all up to the Colossus now."

1589, "You completed your mission too late, pilot. The battle has been lost.  Return to base."

1590, "The Shivans have scrambled a wing of fighters, designation Cancer. Do not let them impede your mission, Alpha."

1591, "We have eliminated Cancer wing."

1592, "Return to Babel"

1593, "The 203rd must capture the NTF Iceni, Admiral Bosch's command ship.
"

1594, "Colossus Triumphant

At 0345 hours, the GTVA Colossus destroyed the Shivan juggernaut Sathanas near the Gamma Draconis jump node in Capella. This victory proves without a doubt our technological superiority over our Great War nemesis. For the second time, the Alliance defeated a species which has annihilated entire civilizations across this galaxy. 

With the Colossus, we will have nothing more to fear."

1595, "Damage Control

We still have much to accomplish, however. The Sathanas inflicted moderate damage against the Colossus, though its systems remain 80% operational. Terran and Vasudan engineers anticipate it will take several months to fully repair the warship's hull. Until we completely secure the nebula, our evacuation of Capella's civilian population will proceed as planned."

1596, "Chasing the Iceni

With the immediate Shivan threat neutralized, we must now focus on capturing Admiral Bosch. Recon units are scouring the nebula for any sign of his command ship. The Psamtik will lead a task force assigned to recover the Iceni once its position has been determined.

Command has disclosed new information concerning the NTF's secret agenda."

1597, "ETAK

We now know that Admiral Bosch has developed a Shivan communication technology that transmits and modulates quantum pulses. Bosch secretly resurrected a defunct GTI project involving captured Shivan specimen, terminated after the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. Bosch referred to his project as ETAK, short for Etamnanki, the tower that may have inspired the story of Babel."

1598, "Stealing History

Through a rigorous study of Ancient archeology, Bosch learned the location of the Knossos subspace device, the portal to the region of the galaxy where the Ancients first encountered the Shivans. His genocidal war was a smoke screen to cover his plunder of Ancient sites in Vasudan systems. In Deneb, he learned how to activate the portal and deployed the Trinity to power up the device."

1599, "An Infernal Pact

Integral to Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra was an alliance with the Shivans upon their return to our systems. When Bosch realized his regime was on the brink of collapse, he ordered his forces into the nebula to make contact with the enemy. Interrogation of rebel prisoners reveals that only Bosch's immediate subordinates had access to the ETAK project. No further details are available at your level of clearance."

1600, "Circe

You are now authorized to use the GTW-19 Circe. Derived from advanced EM weaponry, the Circe disrupts shield systems by directing a barrage of fluctuating EM harmonics on the target. This energy is completely ineffective against armor plating or insulated subsystems. For this reason, the Circe is best paired with a weapon such as the Maxim or the Prometheus, which inflict heavy hull damage."

1601, "Reconnaissance has located the NTF Iceni. Bosch has made contact with the Shivans a second time. An Azrael-class transport is currently docked with the vessel. A second transport appears to be waiting nearby. We do not know if the Shivans are boarding the Iceni, or if Bosch and his followers are boarding the transports."

1602, "Our objective is to capture the $h Iceni and the ETAK technology. Two Shivan cruisers are guarding the vessel, the $h Azmedaj and the $h Sammael. Once the cruisers have been destroyed, we will deploy a Special Forces unit to board and secure the rebel command ship. Your second objective will be to defend our transport, the $f GVT $f Qeb."

1603, "To our knowledge, the $h Iceni holds the only example of the ETAK technology in existence. Bosch took extraordinary measures to destroy all evidence of his research. If we fail, we have little hope of rebuilding the device. Command has absolute faith in your ability to succeed in this endeavor."

1604, "Our transport failed to dock with the Iceni. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and we lost the communication technology. All evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1605, "Use your squadmates to cover multiple objectives."

1606, "The GVT Qeb rescued the survivors of the Iceni and retrieved the specifications for Bosch's ETAK device. 

Command has classified these materials Level Omega, accessible only by persons specially authorized by the GTVA Security Council. Be advised that divulging any information regarding this operation is punishable under the GTVA Security Act, Antares Convention, Section 15-5-7.

We arrived too late to stop the Azrael transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his immediate subordinates. Our questioning of the survivors reveals the encounter had been violent. The motives of the Shivans cannot be determined, though it seems Bosch's experiment attracted their attention. Reconnaissance is now searching for the Shivan transport.

Against overwhelming odds, you destroyed the Shivan cruisers, protected the Iceni, and escorted the transport safely home. It is indeed an honor to serve with a pilot of your caliber."

1607, "The Shivans destroyed the GVT Qeb while the transport was still docked with the Iceni. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and all evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1608, "We were almost there, pilot. Our transport was mere seconds away from jumping to safety. The NTF survivors and our boarding party are now dead, and all evidence of Bosch's ETAK project has been destroyed. 

I regret to inform you that your participation in the officer exchange program has been terminated by order of Vasudan Tactical Command. I petitioned in your favor but to no avail. You faced overwhelming odds, and many of our own Vasudan pilots died in the struggle. However, Command failed to anticipate the intensity of the Shivan attack. 

You must not blame yourself, pilot. You are, after all, only human."

1609, "Our transport failed to dock with the Iceni, and we lost the ETAK technology. All evidence of Bosch's research has been destroyed.

1617, "I am now reading the Iceni at 1200 meters. The Azrael is docked with the command ship. The first Shivan transport has departed, Command."

1632, "This is the GVT Qeb. We are now in position. Commencing docking sequence."

1633, "Qeb here. Docking point secure. Iceni, stand by for boarding."

1634, "This is Victor 3. We've entered a slaughterhouse, Command. Casualty rate in the thousands. Shivan bodies are among the dead. Proceeding now to deck seven."

1635, "All survivors are now on board the transport. We have the specifications. Undocking now."

1636, "This is the Qeb. Now making the jump to subspace."

1637, "Mission accomplished, pilots. You are authorized to return to base."

1638, "This is Lt. Rusk, NTF Iceni! We need immediate extraction! Please assist!"

1639, "What's your status, Iceni?"

1640, "The Shivans boarded us! They killed everyone!  I've got thirty-three survivors on deck seven. There's got to be more below."

1641, "Where's Admiral Bosch?"

1642, "They took him away, with Gibson and Sarno and about a dozen others. You've got to get us out of here NOW!"

1643, "Is the communication technology on board?"

1644, "Listen to me! Bosch initiated the self-destruct sequence! We have only a few minutes left!"

1645, "Transmit the specifications of the ETAK device now, Iceni."

1646, "No can do. You get us out alive, Command, I'll get you those specs! You understand?"

1647, "Acknowledged. Now deploying GVT Qeb. Stand by."

1648, "Our fighters must eliminate these cruisers first, Iceni. Stand by."

1649, "I'm telling you there's no time, Command! Get us out of here now!"

1650, "Hull integrity has fallen below critical! We're gonna die out here, Command! Get us some fighter cover!"

1651, "Iceni, we've lost the GVT Qeb. We're deploying a second transport."

1652, "Self-destruct in thirty seconds, Command! You're out of time."

1653, "Transmit the specs, Lieutenant. This is your last chance to redeem yourself."

1654, "Sorry, Command. We're taking that secret to hell with us. Believe me. You don't want to know. Rusk out."

1655, "The Azrael has undocked with the Iceni. The vessel is preparing to engage its subspace drive."

1656, "We've lost the transport! Repeat! We've lost the transport!"

1657, "Straight, No Chaser"

1658, "The 203rd pursues the Shivan Azrael transport to an uncharted region of the nebula."

1659, "At 1640 hours, reconnaissance detected the Shivan transport carrying Admiral Bosch and his subordinates deep within a Shivan-controlled zone of the nebula. A wing of $h Maras repelled our recon unit, but we now have an approximate location. Alpha and Beta, your mission is to find and disable the $h Azrael transport."

1660, "The attack must be executed quickly, before the transport escapes. Once its engines are disabled, defend the transport until the recovery team arrives on $f Lambda $f 1. They will dock with the $h Azrael and haul the vessel back to Gamma Draconis. $f Lambda $f 2 will be standing by in case $f Lambda $f 1 should fail."

1661, "Capturing Bosch and his lieutenants is of the utmost importance. We do not know if they are alive or dead, or what the Shivans intend to do with them."

1662, "Welcome to the GVD Memphis, Terran. The annihilation of the Psamtik and the thousands on board is a tragedy for all Vasudans. A people birthed in sorrow will die in sorrow, as the old proverb goes. The discovery of the second Knossos portal was of extraordinary significance, but there will be no expedition.

Allied forces have sighted multiple Sathanas-class juggernauts converging on our positions throughout the nebular theater. We stand on the brink of a new Shivan resurgence, and our systems are once again in jeopardy. 

For the second time, Command has ordered a full retreat of all allied vessels from the nebula. We will withdraw immediately to the Capella system, where we will mount our defense. However, not even the Colossus has the firepower to repel a juggernaut fleet.

With the disappearance of the Azrael, and the extreme secrecy surrounding the Alliance's handling of the ETAK project, it could be many years before we learn what happened out here."

1672, "Command, we are under attack!"

1673, "We are reading hostile indicators on radar. Unable to acquire lock."

1674, "Maintain your current heading. Recon tracked the Azrael to that position. It must be somewhere nearby."

1676, "Say again, pilot? Another subspace portal?"

1677, "Affirmative. The device has been activated."

1678, "Can you locate the Azrael?"

1679, "Negative. There is no sign of the Shivan transport."

1680, "All units, secure the area! Nullify all enemy ships! We have a new objective! We must seize control of this portal!"

1681, "We are picking up a Cain-class cruiser on sensors, the SC Dahaka!"

1686, "9,000 meters? You're way off course, Psamtik! What happened?"

1687, "The subspace field generated by the portal appears to have interfered with our transit."

1688, "Pilots, head directly for the Psamtik. We need time to get the ship into position."

1689, "The Psamtik will spearhead our exploration of the region beyond the portal. You will escort the Psamtik until we deploy our expeditionary force."

1690, "All units, defend the Psamtik! Do not allow the Shivan attack to build momentum!"

1691, "What is it, Psamtik? Can you identify?"

1692, "Affirmative! Sathanas configuration! Repeat! Sathanas configuration!"

1693, "That's impossible, Psamtik!"

1694, "The Sathanas has opened fire! We are sustaining massive hull damage!"

1695, "Psamtik, get out of there! Now! We're pulling you out!"

1696, "Jump drive inoperative! All systems compromised! Catastrophic hull failure imminent!"

1697, "Psamtik, do you copy? Come in, Psamtik! This is Allied Command! Do you read me?"

1698, "Pilots, you will jump to the GVD Memphis. Your nav computer has the coordiantes. Return to base!"

1704, "Admiral Petrarch reports that his gunners destroyed the $h Urobach and all but one of the fighter wings. With the entire Shivan armada now heading for Terran-Vasudan space, we must get the $f Aquitaine out as soon as possible. Your mission is to defend the $f Aquitaine until its propulsion systems are restored."

1705, "A damage control team is currently en route from Gamma Draconis. The $f GTC $f Agrippa, an Aeolus-class warship, escorts the $f Argo transport carrying the team and the components needed for the repair. When the $f Argo arrives, your objective will be to ensure it docks safely with the damaged destroyer."

1706, "The $f Aquitaine's Engineering Officer estimates that once the damage control team arrives with the required materials, the repair will be accomplished in a matter of minutes. However, this provides the Shivans sufficient time to launch additional wings and threaten the $f Aquitaine."

1707, "With sorrow, we remember the 10,000 officers and crew of the GTD Aquitaine. They fought courageously and died with valor. 

Your next assignment would have been on board the Aquitaine, leading the 70th Blue Lions squadron. However, with these recent developments, you have been reassigned to fly support for the 12th Fleet in the remote Wolf 359 system. 

Your transport departs at 0150."

1708, "Stay close to the Aquitaine. Use its defenses to your advantage."

1709, "Because of your actions, the GTD Aquitaine safely reached the Gamma Draconis system. The damage to the vessel's fighterbay and targeting system is now being repaired. 

Vasudan Tactical Command has informed us you are to be transferred immediately to the GTD Aquitaine for your next assignment. You will serve as leader of the elite 70th Blue Lions. However, you have also received an urgent transmission from Special Operations Command. Your talents are in demand, pilot. 

For your exceptional service to the crown of Emperor Khonsu II, Heir of the Dynasty of Ten Thousand Years, you are hereby inducted into the Imperial Order of Vasuda. Rarely is this honor conferred upon those of your species. Congratulations, Terran."

Nine Sathanas juggernauts have now entered the Capella system, and Intelligence has sighted even more in the nebula, converging on the jump node to Terran-Vasudan space. 

We are on the threshold of a new apocalypse. Though the juggernauts have not engaged our warships, they have set course for the Capella star. We can only speculate about their intentions, but this development cannot bode well for the Alliance."

1751, "Exodus

Allied Command is committed to evacuating all non-essential personnel. A contingency plan is in the works to hold the Shivans here, in Capella, and prevent the expansion of the Shivan incursion to other systems of the GTVA. 

The 70th Blue Lions will provide the fighter cover needed to get our convoys out of the system. Millions of lives are at stake here, pilot. And if we fail, all our worlds and systems will be in jeopardy."

1752, "Erinyes Fighter

The GTVA has just unveiled the newly developed Erinyes-class heavy assault fighter. With eight gun banks, you'll have sufficient firepower to make short work of enemy targets at close range.  The Erinyes can accommodate fire control for up to two different primary systems. 

You may need to allocate more power to weapons to fight effectively, so make adjustments as needed."

1753, "GTW UD-8 Kayser

You have also been issued the GTW UD-08 Kayser. For its limited OpEval period, only select units will be authorized to carry this weapon. The Kayser emits focused wavelets of subatomic particles that bombard the target, causing the wave function of the particles to collapse and emit intense zero-point energy microbursts. The Kayser is the product of our research into Shivan weapon technology."

1754, "GTM-11 Infyrno

Finally, we have received the new GTM-11 Infyrno, a wide-area fighter suppression warhead. To use the Infyrno, press your secondary trigger once to launch the missile, then press it again to detonate. A HUD indicator will display the distance of the warhead from your ship.  Upon detonation, the Infyrno releases multiple submunitions which themselves contain ultra-high explosive charges."

1755, "As we speak, convoys of transports, freighters, and medical ships are heading for the jump nodes to Vega and Epsilon Pegasi. The evacuation of civilian personnel proceeds on schedule, but the enemy offensive has intensified. We have blockaded the Gamma Draconis node, though Shivan forces are swarming into the system."

1756, "The 53rd will relieve the 309th at the Gamma Draconis node, and we'll deploy the 19th to hold down the fort at 3rd Fleet Headquarters as we evacuate non-essential personnel. Command needs a closer look at the Juggernauts, so we'll be sending in the 91st.  70th Blue Lions will be sortied to the Epsilon Pegasi node."

1757, "Blue Lions, your mission is to escort a four-ship convoy to Epsilon Pegasi. The group consists of civilian transports $f Lambda $f 1 and $f 2, $f GTFr $f Sulla, and the medical ship $f GTM $f Vesalius. All have minimal armaments and vulnerable hull plating. $f GVCv $f Nebtuu leads the escort."

1758, "At 1415 hours, the Shivan corvette $h Abraxis and a wing of $h Manticore fighters attacked the convoy. The $f Nebtuu called for assistance, so you're going in. Theta wing will stand by to reinforce your position. Call them in at your discretion. Good luck, pilots. The people of Capella are counting on you."

1759, "Do not jump out until ordered to do so. You should not be making this mistake at this stage of your career."

1760, "Excellent work, pilot. Your first sortie as leader of the 70th Blue Lions proved you are just the officer to lead this outfit. The Shivans launched a savage attack, but you and your squadron held them off. Because of your tactical leadership, the entire convoy safely reached Epsilon Pegasi. 
"

1761, "The Shivans launched a massive offensive against all our outbound convoys. The death toll has escalated into the hundred of thousands. We do not have the resources to defend every ship escaping this system. Even your elite 70th Blue Lions failed to complete all mission objectives."

1762, "Both Lambda transports perished in the Shivan attack. Thousands of civilians were lost."

1763, "Both Lambda transports reached Epsilon Pegasi. Your efforts saved thousands of lives. "

1764, "One of the Lambda transports reached the jump node. Half the civilians perished in the Shivan attack."

1765, "Relief workers in Vega and Epsilon Pegasi report a shortage of vital provisions and medical supplies. The loss of the Sulla will only complicate matters."

1766, "We managed to save the GTFr Sulla. The provisions it carried will help alleviate the supply shortages in Epsilon Pegasi."

1767, "The destruction of the GTM Vesalius is a tragedy. With the casualties the Shivans have inflicted in Capella, every medical vessel is vital to our efforts."

1768, "The GTM Vesalius arrived in Epsilon Pegasi. The medical vessel will play a crucial role in handling the influx of refugees from Capella."

1769, "Your squadron eliminated all hostile targets. If we are to halt the Shivan advance, every effort must be made to diminish the enemy force."

1770, "We need to deploy your unit to 3rd Fleet Headquarters pronto. Assemble your squadron in the ready room."

1803, "We've lost Lambda 2! They're slaughtering us out there!"

1804, "Lambda 1! Come in, Lambda 1! We've lost your signal! "

1805, "The GTM Vesalius has been destroyed. All personnel on board were lost."

1806, "Alpha, the Nebtuu is gone. All allied warships are currently engaged. You're on your own out there."

1807, "The Shivans wiped out our entire convoy. Return to base, Alpha."

1808, "The Sulla has engaged its jump drives and is now en route for Epsilon Pegasi."

1809, "The civilians are now all accounted for. 50% survived the engagement. "

1815, "At 2345 hours, Allied Command authorized the immediate evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters in the Capella system. The installation has come under heavy fighter and bomber attack. The Shivans are deploying their wings from the $h SD $h Nebiros, a Ravana-class destroyer. The 19th squadron, assigned to defend headquarters, has been wiped out."

1816, "The evacuation will proceed as follows. $f Lambda $f 1, an Argo-class transport, will dock with the installation. Personnel will then board the Argo, which will take them to the $f GTD $f Messana. Command will deploy a second transport to extract the remaining personnel on board the installation. The injured have already been transferred to the medical vessel $f GTM $f Galen."

1817, "After $f Lambda $f 2 has docked with the $f Orion, the $f Messana will leave the system, and you will be authorized to return to base. You will take Alpha and Delta wings and provide fighter cover for this operation. You must protect the installation, the $f Messana, and the two transports. Once evacuated, the installation will be destroyed."

1818, "We have already extracted non-essential personnel, so the operation should proceed quickly. With the evacuation of Headquarters, the Alliance is preparing to initiate the final phase of its plan to hold the Shivans in Capella."

1819, "Outstanding work, pilot. Both Lambda transports safely docked with the GTD Messana. The evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters was a complete success. Under your capable leadership, the 70th Blue Lions upholds its standing among the elite squadrons of the Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance.

The GTVA Security Council has revealed its strategy for holding the Shivans in the Capella system. I will address the officers and crew of the Aquitaine in one hour. The 70th Blue Lions will play a critical role in the upcoming operation. I know that you and your squadron are up to the challenge."

1820, "Though we lost the first transport, Lambda 2 safely docked with the GTD Messana. The evacuation of 3rd Fleet Headquarters was only a partial success. Under the circumstances, this outcome is perhaps the best we could hope for. However, may I remind you that elite squadrons earn their status by going above and beyond the call of duty.

1824, "The loss of the GTD Messana is a tragedy. Many friends and colleagues perished today, and we are left only to ask what could we have done to save them. As Commanding Officer of the Aquitaine, I placed my faith in you and your squadron. The 70th Blue Lions have earned a reputation as one of the finest units in the GTVA. But reputations do not save lives. Reputations do not achieve results. I have no choice but to relieve you of your command. You are dismissed, pilot."

1868, "The 70th Blue Lions participate in a feint at the Gamma Draconis jump node.
"

1869, "Exodus

With over one hundred thousand casualties and more Shivans incoming, we have no hope of holding Capella. Our only real chance is to seal off the system and prevent the invasion from spreading to other Terran-Vasudan worlds. If we fail to contain the Shivan advance, we will unleash the second Great War, a conflict we have virtually no chance of surviving. The Lucifer fleet we defeated 32 years ago is nothing compared to the strength of this armada. Command is committed to getting every last Terran out of the system."

1870, "A Subspace Anomaly

Over 80 Shivan Juggernauts are now in position around the Capella sun. Science vessels monitoring their activity have detected an anomalous subspace field rippling from the Juggernaut fleet. Though we can barely detect the field with our instruments, its intensity has been increasing slowly over the past seventy-two hours. We have known since the Great War that the Shivans possess advanced subspace technologies, but this field goes beyond our wildest speculations. The Shivans may be powering up a new kind of weapon, the likes of which we have never before encountered."

1871, "Sacrifice

Preparations are now underway to collapse the Epsilon Pegasi jump node. A Great-War-era destroyer, the GTD Bastion, will contain multiple meson warheads that will detonate inside the node. Scientists believe an explosion of sufficient magnitude will cause this node to collapse, as evidenced by the destruction of the Lucifer 32 years ago. The detonation of the Lucifer's reactors sealed off the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis and severed all contact with Earth. The Bastion has completed its modifications in the Vega system and is now entering Capella."

1872, "Will the Strategy Work?

Skeptics have argued the Shivans made intersystem jumps without using nodes in Ross 128, Ikeya, Vega, and other systems at the outbreak of the Great War. However, scientists assure us this plan will work. Though Shivans have used uncharted nodes and nodes too unstable for Terran and Vasudan vessels, they are as dependent on jump nodes as we are. Nevertheless, we must accept this strategy as nothing more than a temporary measure."

1873, "Endgame

Once we have evacuated all civilian and military personnel from the Capella system, we will send a second destroyer, also carrying meson warheads, through the Capella jump node in Vega. If we succeed in sealing off both nodes, the Alliance will have trapped the Shivans in this system. If we fail, we face certain annihilation. 

This is our Alamo, pilots. We hold them here, or we die trying."

1874, "The $f GTD $f Bastion will enter the Capella system at 1835 hours. We're sending in the 116th to escort the warship into position. Our forward observer units near the Juggernauts are calling for backup, so we'll send in the 83rd. The 309th will assist with the containment effort at the Vega node, and as for the 70th Blue Lions, we've got something special for you."

1875, "Your mission is to create a diversion at the Gamma Draconis node. The operation here will be a feint to lure the Shivan armada. The $f Colossus and its group will form a battle line near the node. By focusing our firepower here, we'll draw the brunt of the Shivan offensive. Meanwhile, on the other side of the system, the $f Bastion will collapse the node to Epsilon Pegasi."

1876, "Your objectives are simple. Destroy all enemy targets. Be advised reinforcements will not be readily available. In a recent engagement, the $f Colossus sustained damage to its fighterbays. You'll have to hold out until they get the flight deck cleared. Good luck, pilot."

1877, "The Colossus has been destroyed. Over thirty thousand officers and crew, our colleagues, compatriots, and friends, perished in this battle. The most powerful Terran-Vasudan warship ever constructed, twenty years in the making, was vaporized in a matter of minutes.

Command acknowledges there was nothing you could have done to save the Colossus. Many of your squadmates were killed, and you are lucky to have survived the engagement. However, we have no time to mourn the dead. We have a job to do, and if we fail, millions more will suffer and die.

The 70th Blue Lions are being scrambled to assist the Bastion. Report to the ready room on the double."

The $f Bastion will be detonated inside the node to create a subspace cataclysm that will seal off the Capella system. If the $f Bastion fails to achieve this objective, the Shivans will swarm into our adjacent systems."

1912, "The task force defending the $f Bastion has been decimated. Three ships remain: the $f Templar, the $f Malta, and the $f Ertanax. All are Aeolus-class cruisers. The Shivans continue to send wave after wave of fighters and bombers. Only a handful of the $f Bastion's original fighter complement have survived the onslaught."

1913, "Alpha, Delta, and Beta wings will fly heavy intercept. Your mission is to take out enemy bombers before they close within targeting distance. You'll be armed with the Trebuchet missile, which has an effective range of four kilometers. Gamma wing will fly the Perseus. Their role will be to engage enemy fighters. "

1914, "The majority of the fleet is fending off a massive attack at the Vega node. Thousands of civilians await evacuation and the enemy continues to flood in from Gamma Draconis.

The Security Council has authorized the deployment of the $f GTD $f Nereid. The destroyer will depart from the Vega system and collapse the node in fifteen minutes. We must therefore complete our evacuation of Capella by that time. Any ship that remains behind will be trapped with the Shivan armada.

Your objective is to defend our convoys as they flee through the Vega node. Cargo ships, personnel transports, medical vessels, and the remnants of the allied fleet are now in transit. These convoys are under heavy bomber fire. If we don't provide cover, thousands will die. 

Your secondary objective is to prevent Shivan warships from entering the Vega node. The Allied fleet has been pulverized, so for the sake of all Terrans and Vasudans, the war must end here. You will receive authorization to enter the Vega node and leave the system once the $f Nereid has been deployed."

Welcome to Vega, Ensign. I am Lieutenant Loukakis, squadron leader of the 53rd Hammerheads. You have been assigned to our unit. The Hammerheads are a space superiority squadron. We'll be flying the Myrmidon fighter, developed to replace the old GTF Ulysses. The Myrmidon is a Terran-Vasudan design and a versatile ship with high marks for speed, maneuverability, armor, and loadout."

2118, "History of the 53rd

The 53rd Hammerheads were formed during the Great War. At the time, we served on board the GTD Bastion, the finest ship in the history of Terran space travel. You may not know this, but the pilots who destroyed the SD Lucifer in 2335 were based on the Bastion, and some were even Hammerheads. With the 53rd, you're part of a long and proud tradition."

When the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the jump node to the Sol system and severed all contact with Earth, Command transferred the Bastion to the 4th Fleet in Vega. Since then we've called Vega our home. Now Command has de-commissioned the Bastion and reassigned its squadrons to the newer Hecate destroyers. We'll be joining the GTD Aquitaine, flagship of the 3rd Fleet, Capella."

2225, "Your weapons loadout is displayed to the right of your reticle. Primary cannons are listed above your secondary missile banks."

2226, "Use your primary weapon selector [Press $.$] to toggle either one or both cannons to fire. Firing both primaries will inflict more damage but will also drain more energy from your fighter's reserves."

2227, "The Myrmidon space superiority fighter has three missile banks. As a new pilot, you will be authorized to use the Tempest dumbfire and the Rockeye heat-seeker. Let's practice firing the Tempest."

2228, "Use your secondary weapon selector [Press $/$] to arm your bank of Tempest missiles."

2229, "Good. Tempests are dumb-fire projectiles. These warheads have no homing system, so they'll fly in the direction in which they are fired. For this reason, they are most effective at close range. Unless your aim is very precise, hitting targets at a distance with the Tempest may be difficult."

2230, "Now select Drone 01 using your hostile targeting control. [Press $h$]"

2231, "Good. Destroy Drone 01 with your Tempest missiles. [Press $spacebar$] Close your distance if you need to."

2232, "Well done. The Tempest may not be as accurate as a heat- or aspect-seeking missile, but a Myrmidon can carry up to 320 of these missiles. A volley of Tempests will quickly pulverize an enemy fighter."

2233, "To maximize their effectiveness, use them in conjunction with your Subach HL-7. While the lasers penetrate the shields of your target, the missiles will impact the enemy's hull."

2234, "Let's move on to the Rockeye heat-seeker. Arm the Rockeye with your secondary weapon selector. [Press $/$]"

2235, "Well done. Now target Drone 02. [Press $h$]"

2236, "When you fire the Rockeye, the missile's tracking system will lock onto the heat signature of your target. Be aware the homing radius of the Rockeye is limited, and your target must be near the center of your HUD."

2237, "Destroy Drone 02 using your Rockeye missiles. [Press $spacebar$]"

2238, "Nice shooting, pilot. Compared to the Tempest, the Rockeye is more accurate and has a greater effective range. However, the Myrmidon can carry no more than 20 Rockeyes."

2239, "You can also toggle double-fire mode to launch twice the ordnance. [Press $Shift-/$] You will inflict more damage and increase your chances of hitting the target, but your missiles will be depleted more rapidly in double-fire mode."

2240, "We will now send in more drones so you can practice firing missiles. Be sure to toggle between banks so you can get a feel for both the Tempest and the Rockeye."

2241, "When you run low on missiles, you need to rearm your fighter. To do this you must call in a support ship."

2242, "First, press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging window, followed by the [5] key to Rearm."

2243, "In order for the support ship to dock, you must bring your fighter to a complete stop.  The support ship will then automatically dock with you."

2244, "In the lower portion of your HUD, an indicator displays the support ship's ETA."

2245, "The support ship's primary purpose is twofold.  First, it will reload your secondary weapons and countermeasures."

2246, "Second, the support ship is capable of making minor repairs to your ship.  It can fully repair any damaged or destroyed subsystem.  However, the support ship cannot repair your hull."

2247, "Keep in mind a support ship can only load as many weapons as it has on board.  It may not be enough to completely rearm your fighter."

2248, "We covered a lot in this module. If you need to review this material, replay the simulation. Otherwise, you are qualified to proceed to TSM-103a. Engage your subspace drive."

2293, "This drone is armed.  It will start firing upon you in 10 seconds.  Destroy it."

2294, "You're sustaining a lot of damage from that drone. You may need to review the first two training modules."

"

2305, "Welcome to the Squadron

Welcome to the 107th Ravens, pilot. I'm Lieutenant Samsa, squadron leader.  As you know, the Aquitaine is now en route to the Gamma Draconis system. The details of the situation there have been classified at the highest level, so I'm as much in the dark as you are. The Admiral will brief the crew when we reach 3rd Fleet headquarters in Capella."

2306, "The 107th Ravens

The 107th is a heavy assault squadron, so our fighter of choice is the Hercules Mark II. Implementing advances in fusion drive technology, the Mark II improves the assault fighter's speed and maneuverability without sacrificing loadout. The Herc has only two missile banks, but its ordnance capacity is greater than the Myrmidon's. The original Herc won the Great War, so we're proud to carry on the tradition."

2307, "The Hercules Mark II

I recommend that you review the Herc II training modules before the Aquitaine arrives in Capella. These modules review advanced tactics, such as countermeasures and energy management. The Herc II is slower than the Myrmidon you've been flying with the 53rd, so learn how to evade missiles and equalize shields. These skills will help you push your fighter to the limits. Master them, and the life you save may be your own."

2308, "New Weapons

According to your file, you are now authorized to use the GTW-5a Prometheus R, the GTM-19 Harpoon, and the GTM-4 Hornet missile. 

The Prometheus R is a retrofit of a cannon developed during the Great War. After the Alliance lost contact with Earth, we lacked materials required for mass production, so engineers developed this retrofit version. The Prometheus packs a bigger wallop than the Subach HL-7, but it will drain your power reserves with extended use."

2309, "New Weapons

The Harpoon and the Hornet are both aspect-seeking missiles. While the Harpoon fires individual warheads, the Hornet launches a swarm of four projectiles, eight if you're in double-fire mode. The training modules cover the proper technique for firing aspect-seeking missiles, so be sure to review that section carefully. That's all for now, pilot. The Aquitaine will arrive in Capella in four hours."

2310, "Welcome to training simulator module TSM-107m, advanced qualification for the Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter. This module has been designed to acquaint pilots with communications systems, countermeasures, and aspect-seeking missiles."

2311, "Well done, pilot. You have successfully completed TSM-107m, advanced qualification for the Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter. You are advised to proceed to training simulator module TSM-107se, covering shield management and the energy transfer system."

2312, "Your performance was below acceptable standards for TSM-107m, advanced qualification for the Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter. You will not be advised to advance to the next training simulator module until you have completed this unit successfully. "

2331, "Let's begin with messaging."

2332, "For Class A qualification, you learned how to call in a support ship to rearm and repair subsystems. Now we'll show you how to give orders to pilots under your command."

2333, "Our target for this simulation will be an Argo-class transport."

2334, "Target the transport. Use your hostile targeting control. [$h$]"

2335, "Good. Now you'll call in your reinforcements. Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window. Select reinforcements [4]. Then select the wing you want to call in. Epsilon wing is your only option, so hit the [1] key."

2336, "Confirm that you still have the transport targeted. [$h$]"

2337, "Now have Epsilon wing destroy the transport. Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up your messaging box again."

2338, "Select [2] to transmit your orders to a specific wing. Then hit [1] to choose Epsilon wing.  By selecting Epsilon wing, you are sending your orders to that wing only."

2339, "Now press the [1] key, and Epsilon will destroy your target."

2340, "Well done, pilot! Let's try this again."

2341, "Order Epsilon wing to destroy Transport 02. Do you remember your previous instruction?  If not, consult the directives list."

2342, "Good work. Be aware that fighter wings are less effective against larger targets. Bombers or vessels with beam turrets are usually required to destroy warships larger than cruiser class."

2343, "Also note that reinforcements are not always available, and you will have authorization to issue orders only to specific wings and ships."

2344, "Now let's order Epsilon wing to depart."

2345, "Press the communications [$c$] key to bring up the messaging window.  Select [2] for wing, and [1] for Epsilon.  Finally, press [0] for Depart."

2346, "Excellent work. As you gain experience in combat, using the communications interface will become second nature."

2347, "All right, pilot. Now it's time to learn about countermeasures."

2348, "When you launch a countermeasure, you present a new target for pursuing missiles. In theory, the missiles should hit the countermeasure instead of ripping a hole through your hull."

2349, "You need to use countermeasures to survive in battle, but you'll soon learn this tactic does not always work."

2350, "For this exercise, we'll bring in a Leviathan-class cruiser."

2351, "The cruiser will now launch missiles at you.  Press the countermeasures [$x$] key to evade the missiles."

2352, "Immediately increase your forward velocity to maximum and move away from the pursuing missiles.  Punch your afterburners [$tab$] to gain that extra burst of speed."

2353, "A yellow triangle will appear on your HUD, indicating the vector of the missile's approach. Try to keep this indicator in the 3 or 9 o'clock position."

2354, "When the missile is nearly upon you, launch the countermeasure.  Listen to the beeping sound of the missile lock to gauge the distance of the missile. The quicker the beeps, the closer the missile."

2355, "While launching countermeasures, turn your fighter hard in sharp movements. This will also help throw the missile off your trail."

2356, "If you evade the missile, an indicator will display in the upper portion of your targeting reticle. This will alert you to the fact that you successfully avoided the projectile."

2357, "The number of countermeasures remaining is indicated on your HUD below the weapons display. If you run out of countermeasures, call in the support ship to reload."

2358, "You've sustained heavy damage from those missiles, pilot. You are advised to review TSM-107m. Your chances of survival will be minimal if you cannot use countermeasures effectively."

2359, "That's enough for evading missiles. Now let's practice firing them."

2360, "Your Hercules Mark II heavy assault fighter is armed with two banks of Harpoons."

2361, "Unlike heat-seekers like the Rockeye, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home."

2362, "However, the aspect seeker is well worth the effort because its homing ability is much stronger."

2363, "If a heat seeker loses track of its target, chances are it will not reacquire lock. Aspect seekers, on the other hand, will track their targets until they detonate."

2364, "Transport 03 is now entering.  Let's take this opportunity to learn another targeting control."

2365, "You have a reticle targeting control [$y$] that will acquire the nearest object inside your reticle. Maneuver your fighter so that my ship is centered on your HUD."

2366, "Good. Now use the reticle targeting control [$y$] to target my fighter."

2367, "Well done. Now target Transport 03 using the reticle targeting control. [$y$] Make sure the transport is in the center of your HUD."

2368, "Excellent. Now let's see how you do with those Harpoons."

2369, "Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Triangle.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This means your Harpoons are locked and ready to fire."

2370, "Now fire one Harpoon at the freighter."

2371, "Note how fast the Harpoon moves.  This warhead delivers quite a punch."

2372, "A round of Harpoons can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge."

2373, "The Harpoon is almost useless if fired before lock has been acquired. That's a major distinction between the Harpoon and the Rockeye."

2374, "Now unload your Harpoons until you've destroyed Transport 03."

2375, "Excellent job.  Let's see how you do against moving targets."

2376, "In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed position inside your HUD reticle."

2377, "We'll now bring in the fighter drones. When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock. Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle."

2378, "Once you have acquired lock, fire a Harpoon to destroy the drone.  These drones will not be using countermeasures."

2379, "Well done.  All aspect seekers function this way, from the Hornet missile to the Helios torpedo. In general, the larger and more powerful the warhead, the longer it will take to acquire lock and countdown between volleys."

2380, "Now let's have you face a real challenge.  Multiple wings will appear simultaneously.  Destroy them all."

2381, "You must be in range of your target before you can gain aspect lock.  Hit your burners to intercept the drones."

2382, "Your missile banks are almost depleted. Call in the support ship to rearm. [Press $Shift-R$]"

2383, "Well done. This concludes module TSM-107m. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2404, "First, let's take a look at the gauges and controls for your shield system."

2405, "The Alliance acquired shielding technology from the Shivans during the Great War. Shield systems have been standard on Terran-Vasudan fighters and bombers for over thirty years."

2406, "Your shield system generates an energy shell that protects the hull of your ship from primary fire and missile blasts."

2407, "As they absorb damage, your shields will weaken. However, your fighter will automatically regenerate its shields over time."

2408, "Your shield integrity gauge is located in the lower right of your HUD.  This gauge is now flashing."

2409, "Your shield is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant can withstand limited damage."

2410, "When a shield quadrant sustains damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe."

2411, "Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken a hit."

2412, "Observe how the gauge changes as your shield sustains more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage on that quadrant will impact the hull of your fighter."

2413, "Your shields will regenerate themselves automatically.  Let's accelerate this process to save time."

2414, "Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength."

2415, "Your shield is now fully recharged."

2416, "Effective shield management can mean the difference between life and death."

2417, "The simplest way to manage your shield is the Equalize Quadrants function."

2418, "I have damaged your front quadrant again.  Use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your shields.  [Press $q$]"

2419, "Well done.  Your front section has been partially recharged.  This shield energy came from your other three quadrants."

2420, "Practice this function often."

2421, "I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero power."

2422, "With your shield management controls, you can maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant."

2423, "First, maximize the strength in your front quadrant.  [Press $Up Arrow$ several times.]"

2424, "Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the other quadrants have been drained."

2425, "Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking the turret of a large ship."

2426, "Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]"

2427, "If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can deflect the gunfire of your pursuer."

2428, "Now Equalize Quadrants again to distribute shield energy evenly around your ship. [$q$]"

2429, "We will conclude this module with an overview of your energy transfer system, or ETS."

2430, "You can use your ETS controls to augment or diminish the energy allocated to each of these three systems."

2431, "First, let's increase your weapons energy allocation. [Press $insert$ four times.] Observe that as you divert power to weapons, the energy levels for shields and engines drop."

2432, "The more energy diverted to weapons, the faster your primaries will recharge. Your weapons will not inflict greater damage at higher ETS levels."

2433, "High-energy cannons, such as the Prometheus, can quickly deplete your weapon reserves. If you require a sustained barrage of gunfire, diverting energy to primaries may be necessary."

2434, "Now let's increase your shield allocation. [Press $home$ three times.]"

2435, "The higher your ETS setting for shields, the faster they'll recharge. Increasing your shield allocation may be critical in combat situations, such as stopping to rearm your fighter or flying through heavy flak."

2436, "Now divert more power to your engines. [Press $page up$ twice.]"

2437, "Increasing power to engines will improve your maximum speed by up to 30%, depending on the fighter's reactor capacity. Your afterburners will also recharge faster, enabling more frequent bursts of speed."

2438, "For a slower fighter like the Hercules Mark II, increasing engine power may be necessary to chase down more maneuverable targets or cover large distances quickly."

2439, "Well done. This concludes module TSM-107se. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2440, "You did not follow instructions. You have failed module TSM-107se. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation. [$Alt-J$]"

Lieutenant Commander Cordova here. Welcome to the 242nd Suicide Kings, pilot. I've heard from unofficial channels that the rebels have launched a surprise attack in the Epsilon Pegasi system. Details at this point are sketchy below Phi level clearance, and Command is in no hurry to fill us in. Petrarch says he'll brief the Aquitaine when we reach Capella."

2444, "The 242nd Suicide Kings

The GTA formed the Suicide Kings in the Great War, when the old Valkyrie fighter went into service after the Shivan attack on Ross 128. The 242nd was stationed on the Galatea back then, and our first mission was the capture of Lieutenant Alexander McCarthy. We all studied the McCarthy trials in school, pilot. We're a part of history here, though the Galatea is long gone and the Valkyrie has since been retired."

2445, "The Perseus Interceptor

The Perseus is the next-generation interceptor, the fastest fighter in the GTVA. Our primary combat role is charging bombers and chasing down warheads. We're also assigned to surgical strikes against bigger warships. We're not called the Suicide Kings for nothing, pilot. We earn that name on every mission. For that reason, I suggest you review the Perseus training modules as soon as possible. There you'll learn how to target bombs and turrets and everything else you need to serve in an intercept squadron."

2469, "For this exercise, we need a target. Let's bring in a Deimos-class corvette."

2470, "Remember the escort list? It's on the right-hand side of your HUD. Use the escort targeting control to select the Deimos. [$e$]"

2471, "Good. Now let's make this interesting. Here comes a wing of Shivan Seraphim bombers."

2472, "Don't be afraid. This is only a training simulator. Just observe the action for now."

2473, "As the Seraphim bombers approach the Deimos, they launch their ordnance."

2474, "Use the bomb targeting control [$b$] to acquire the Shivan warheads. If there are no warheads in flight, this control will select the nearest bomber."

2475, "The bomb will appear in your Target View until it detonates. Observe that as the bomb impacts the hull of the Deimos, the name of the corvette flashes in your escort monitor. That's how you know a ship on your escort list is taking damage."

2476, "Bombs also appear as amber blips on your radar."

2477, "Let's cover one more targeting control. The Target's Attacker function [$g$] enables you to select the enemy ship attacking your target. This is especially useful in defensive or escort missions."

2478, "First, select the vessel you have been ordered to defend. Cycle through friendly targets [$f$] or use the escort targeting control. [$e$]"

2479, "Very good. Now use the target's attacker control [$g$] to acquire the nearest hostile currently attacking your target. That would be the Seraphim."

2480, "Now let's see how well you do in a combat situation. To make things fair, we'll restore the Deimos to full strength."

2481, "Before we unleash the bombers, here are a few more pointers."

2482, "First, locate the bomb by sensors or by sight. You'll destroy the bombs more efficiently if you can rely on visual contact, but sometimes you'll need to use the bomb targeting control if you get disoriented. [$b$]"

2483, "It only takes one or two hits to destroy a bomb, and most warheads are generally slower than your intercept fighter. But don't get too close. The shockwave could damage your hull or knock out your subsystems."

2484, "Obviously, the best tactic is to destroy the bombers before they launch their ordnance. An intercept fighter is built for speed so that you can engage multiple bomber waves across the field of engagement."

2485, "You lost the Deimos, pilot. It's a challenge but not impossible. We'll abort the simulation now so you can start over and try again."

2486, "Excellent work, pilot. You repelled the bomber attack and protected the Deimos."

2487, "Here's another tip. Using the messaging window, you can order your squadmates to protect a target. Pilots assigned to protect a target will help you intercept bombs launched at the target. Chasing bombs is a lot easier when you work together as a team."

2488, "You have depleted your missile banks, pilot. Call in the support ship to rearm. [$Shift-R$]"

2489, "For the next phase of this simulation, let's restore the Deimos to full strength. We'll also change the vessel's IFF status from friendly to hostile."

2490, "Target the corvette using your hostile targeting control.  [Press $h$]"

2491, "Good. As a fighter, you have minimal chance of destroying a large ship on your own. Bombs and beam cannons are much more effective, but these weapons are too big to mount on a fighter."

2492, "However, the speed and maneuverability of the fighter make it ideal for surgical strikes against the turrets and subsystems of larger ships."

2493, "Use the turret targeting control [$k$] to cycle through the turrets of the ship. Observe that the corvette has a range of weapon types, including beam weapons, laser cannons, flak guns, and missile launchers. I'm sure you're well acquainted with all of these by now."

2494, "Observe how the turret is outlined by a large square. The Target View will display the type of turret and its current integrity.  If the targeted object is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2495, "Now target the missile launchers on the Deimos and destroy them."

2496, "Excellent. Once you destroy a turret, your sensors will automatically target the next turret in order of priority."

2497, "Larger warships have dozens of firing points, and in combat situations, you might not have time to cycle through all the turrets to find the one that is firing at you."

2498, "You have an attacker targeting control [$r$] that will select the nearest hostile firing on your ship. If the attacker is a warship, the turret firing on you will be targeted."

2499, "This control can help you prioritize the enemies that pose the greatest danger to your fighter."

2500, "Let's try it now. The Deimos will begin firing on you with one or more of its turrets. "

2501, "Use your attacker targeting control [$r$] to identify the turret firing on you."

2502, "Now destroy the turret. Feel free to use guns and missiles. Note that both heat-seeking and aspect-seeking missiles will home in on subsystems once they acquire lock."

2503, "Good. Now let's see how you do against multiple turrets."

2504, "Great work, pilot."

2505, "Looks like you've had enough. In the field of battle, approach a warship with the utmost caution. With a fast and light ship like the Perseus, stay on the move at all times. Destroy the turret in two or three strafing runs if you have to."

2506, "Let's end this session with a look at targeting subsystems."

2507, "By pressing the subsystem targeting control [$s$] repeatedly, you can cycle through the subsystems of your target."

2508, "A subsystem appears on your HUD outlined by a large square. If the targeted system is not in view, it will be marked by a diamond."

2509, "Now target the sensors on the corvette.  [Press $s$]"

2510, "Nice work. Now select the Akheton Subsystem Disruptor Gun, or SDG, as your primary weapons. [$.$]"

2511, "The Akheton SDG is an energy weapon developed by the Vasudans. The Akheton destroys the subsystems of a target, doing only minimal damage to the target's hull."

2512, "Using the Akheton SDG, destroy the sensors of the Deimos corvette."

2513, "Good. Note that you can also order your squadmates to destroy the subsystems of your target. In the messaging window, select the Disable command to take out the engines. The Disarm command will order the pilots to destroy your target's weapons subsystem."

2514, "Well done. This concludes module TSM-122x. Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation."

2515, "You did not follow instructions. You have failed module TSM-122x Engage your subspace drive to end this simulation. [$Alt-J$]"

2516, "Now, intercept and destroy the Seraphim bombers before they neutralize the corvette."

2891, "What about our mission, sir?"

2892, "We have orders to follow, sir."

2893, "You are deserting the field of engagement, Terran."

2894, "You are violating our mission directives, Terran."

2895, "Sorry it had to end like this, sir!"

2896, "No mercy for traitors in this unit!"

2897, "See you in hell, pilot!"

As with the basic Amazon, these are now encountered only in the virtual battlefields of the TSM training module series. The Model VII is used to simulate assaults on enemy capital ships, training fighter and bomber pilots to target turrets and ship subsystems. Command has found that virtual training against Model VIIs increases the survival rate of pilots by 37% when attacking capital ships."

3037, "The GTS Hygeia is the fleet's newest Terran support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle.

The Hygeia's repair facilities are driven by neural-net AI, for ultra-fast system diagnostics and repair. The high number of warheads carried by the Hygeia makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

The ability to distribute supplies and munitions is vital in any theater of operations. With the Triton, battle groups can keep their forces well-equipped, even if dispersed over multiple systems. The Triton not only has the ability to dock with and haul TAC units, but it also has an internal cargo bay for ship-to-ship transfers. The GTVA expects the Triton to reduce its reliance on deep-space depots, which are vulnerable to attack and sabotage."

3039, "TC-TRI containers are made by Triton Dynamics specifically to house fragile replacement parts for TD vessels that must be repaired in the field. Once these parts have been placed in storage at a repair facility, the GTVA reuses the containers in many capacities."

3040, "The GTFr Poseidon is the smaller of the two standard Terran military freighters. Though it carries only half as much cargo as the Triton, the Poseidon is more often chosen for dangerous missions. Its greater speed gives it better survivability on the front lines, as does the fact that it has four weapon turrets, compared to the Triton's two. When Allied Command sends supplies and munitions that have to get through, a Poseidon is usually chosen to transport them."

3041, "
The TC 2 is the standard issue cargo container in the GTVA for deep space cargo transport. Its thin hull will preserve Terran-standard atmospheric conditions inside, as long as the hull seal has not been comprised by weapon fire or collision. TC 2 containers are cheap to manufacture and heavily used everywhere but the front lines (where the armored TAC 1 containers are employed, when available)."

3042, "
The TSC 2 container is armored, providing more protection for its cargo than does the TC 2. This armor serves mainly to protect against hull breaches due to collisions, as it's not thick enough to provide much protection against enemy attacks. TSC 2s are used in busy supply depots in which collision damage is a hazard."

3043, "The TAC 1 is a very heavily armored type of Terran cargo container. It is most often used to hold delicate or valuable cargoes. TAC 1s are generally found in front-line operations in which protection from enemy attacks is a primary consideration."

3044, "The TTC 1 is a civilian cargo container modified for military use. It is a dense-hulled container originally designed to protect fragile technical and scientific equipment. The same protection is now used to guard against collision and attack damage to replacement ship subsystems and other electronic equipment intended for combat spacecraft."

3045, "The GTC Fenris class is the aging stalwart among the Alliance's warships. Before the Great War, the Fenris was Terran Command's only class of cruisers. During the war, Terran Command decided to build a second line of cruisers, the Leviathans, to free the Fenris from escort and guard duties. Fenris cruisers have fought in virtually every theatre of operation. These fast, versatile cruisers pack enough punch in their 260-meter-long hulls to go toe-to-toe with any enemy cruiser. The Fenris's speed and maneuverability make it a good choice for strike missions."

3046, "Terrans developed the GTM Hippocrates early in the post-war Reconstruction period. With the outbreak of the NTF insurgency, the GTVA has once again called the Hippocrates into active military service. Its on-board facilities provide state-of-the-art medical care to thousands of patients. Hippocrates also help transport refugees out of contested systems into the safety of Allied-controlled regions. The unusual design of the Hippocrates enables its crew to isolate sections of the ship quickly in the event of quarantine or hull breach."

3047, "Early in the Great War, Han-Ronald engineers designed and built the Leviathan class of cruisers. The Leviathan is much heavier armed and armored than the Fenris, but also much slower and less maneuverable. Leviathan cruisers are used to guard critical installations, such as permanent jump nodes, deep-space factories, and gas-mining operations, where firepower is king and speed is of little importance. They're also well-suited to escorting slow-moving freighters or transports. The Fenris is good for fast-moving operations, but when you need some muscle, call in a Leviathan."

3048, "The GTSC Faustus is primarily a class of civilian research vessels. During times of peace, they serve as mobile laboratories for scientists in many disciplines. During wartime, however, Faustus vessels are commandeered by the military, mostly for weapons research. It was on a Faustus ship, during the Great War, that Shivan shield technology was first reverse-engineered from a captured Shivan fighter. Faustus vessels have poor armor and only a few weak turrets for defense. Only desperate circumstances find a Faustus anywhere near the front lines."

3049, "When a fighter pilot sees a ship of the GTG Zephyrus class, one thought flashes through his or her mind: 'Thank God I don't have to fly that tub!' The Zephyrus is a gas miner designed to harvest the gases of interstellar nebulae. It's the largest non-combatant ship in the GTVA fleet. The Zephyrus's thin armor, weak weaponry, and poor speed give it a very low survival rate in combat, so these ships stay well back from the front lines. Despite these weaknesses, the Zephyrus plays a critical role in the operation of the GTVA fleet. The deuterium gathered by Zephyrus ships powers the fleet's fusion drives."

3050, "Ships of the GTA Charybdis class have been packed with the latest tachyon-enabled AWACS equipment from GTVI labs. Each GTVA battle group has a squadron of Charybdis-class ships assigned to it. These ships double the range of the group's standard detection arrays. Charybdis ships' thin armor and weak defenses make them easy victims for enemy bombers. They have proven indispensable, however, in forays into the nebula beyond the Knossos portal. Charybdis-class ships are very vulnerable in this environment, as witnessed by the recent loss of the GTA Panopticon from the 3rd Battle Group."

3051, "For over 30 years, the GTD Orion class was the largest ship in the Terran-Vasudan armada. Over two kilometers in length, bristling with dozens of death-dealing turrets, the Orion is as awesome in repose as it is in battle. All GVTA Orions have been retrofitted with the latest anti-warship beam weapons, as well as flak and AAA turrets for dealing with fighters and bombers. The Orion's cavernous hanger bays easily accommodate more than two dozen fighter or bomber wings."

3052, "The new GTD Hecate class of destroyers is replacing the Orion class as the flagship of Terran battle groups. More heavily armed than the Orion, the Hecate also carries over 150 combat spacecraft and a crew of 10,000. The GTD Aquitaine is a superb example of this new ship class, serving as the flagship of the Capella-based 3rd Fleet."

3053, "The GTD Hades was a fusion of Terran and Shivan military technologies. It was constructed by Galactic Terran Intelligence (GTI), a rogue branch of the GTA. In 2335, GTI leaders sought to overthrow the provisional GTA government established in Delta Serpentis. After the defeat of the GTI and the destruction of the Hades, the GTA classified the details of this research at level Omega. There are rumors that the Alliance has attempted to reconstruct the Hades to learn more about the GTI's activities. These reports have yet to be confirmed by government sources."

3054, "The GTI Arcadia is a multi-purpose installation that has served the Terran fleet since the days of the Great War. Almost every major star system is host to at least one Arcadia, which is often used as a center for trade and communications. Home to scores of small ships, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia installation is always a hub of intrasystem and interstellar traffic. An Arcadia is not an easy target for hostile forces, as it combines the firepower of over 20 weapon turrets with the ability to launch up to ten wings of fighters from its fighterbay."

3055, "The GTVA Colossus resulted from an endeavor unprecedented in Terran or Vasudan history. This 6-kilometer-long behemoth is the result of 20 years of joint effort from dozens of contractors of both races. The Colossus is the most powerful space-faring warship ever made, bristling with over 80 weapon turrets. It also houses 60 fighter and bomber wings and requires a crew of over 30,000. The firepower of the Colossus is greater than that of most GTVA battle groups."

3056, "Deimos-class corvettes, such as the GTCv Actium and the GTCv Lysander, are the newest addition to the Terran fleet. These sleek, ultra-modern warships are the products of a new era of ship design, maximizing maneuverability and firepower. Their hulls are strengthened with collapsed-core molybdenum sheathing for better protection against beam fire, and their Vasudan-designed reactor core provides more energy per ton than any other allied ship class. As the Leviathan and Fenris cruisers of the Great War are gradually phased out, these corvettes will become the foundation of tomorrow's fleet."

3057, "The GTC Aeolus is the first cruiser class ever produced by the RNI shipyards orbiting Laramis II. Only two dozen of these cruisers were put into service in GTVA fleets, with production ending in 2365. Allied Command assigns Aeolus-class ships primarily to guard slow-moving convoys against fighter and bomber wings, as these cruisers are severely out-gunned by most capital ships in service today. Their flak and AAA turrets serve as marvelous deterrents to smaller craft, however."

3058, "The Iceni is the NTF command frigate, built under Admiral Bosch's direction at the Freedom shipyards in Polaris, captured by the Neo-Terran Front at the start of their rebellion.  With over two dozen turrets and a sheath of ultra-dense depleted uranium shielding around its subsystems, the Iceni is an extremely tough nut to crack. With Bosch on board, providing tactical guidance, the Iceni is the equal of any GTVA battle group. Intelligence believes the ship was custom-designed for a secret NTF project."

3060, "The GTT Elysium class of transports has been in service for over 40 years. Its mission hasn't changed from the time of the Great War - to transport civilian and military personnel from one star system to another. The Elysium is very poorly armed, with a single Subach HL-7 cannon, and also suffers from thin armor plating. Only desperate circumstances find Elysiums anywhere near the front lines. Assaults and dangerous transport missions handled almost exclusively by the much tougher GTT Argo class."

3061, "The GTT Argo has become the standard military transport vehicle for the Terran fleet. Argos sometimes carry new weapon and combat craft prototypes to and from testing grounds or to front-line deployment positions. Military VIPs occasionally commandeer Argos to travel from star system to star system in some semblance of comfort. Argos are most often used as assault transports, carrying squads of Marines through heavy flak to board enemy vessels that Command has decided to capture rather than destroy."

3062, "The GTI Ganymede is the Alliance's newest repair and resupply facility. Ganymede installations are currently deployed behind the front lines in the Vega, Vasuda, and Capella systems. Each Ganymede can service up to five warships simultaneously. Repairs of any type or degree can be made here, on any ship in the GTVA fleet. Ganymedes also provide retrofitting services, enabling Allied Command to extend the lifetime of aging ships by upgrading weaponry, systems, and engines."

3063, "The subspace portal was discovered in the Gamma Draconis system in 2367. The interlocking circular motions of its components apparently create a subspace vortex that connects the Gamma Draconis system to another part of our universe.  Dr. Hargrove's team continues to study the device, though their findings are highly classified."

3064, "The GTSG Watchdog was the first generation of Terran sentry platform, the distant precursor to the Cerberus and Alastor platforms. Seriously underpowered by today's standards, the Watchdog also suffers from paper-thin armor. Many Watchdogs are Great War relics left active and in place because it wasn't worthwhile removing or deactivating them. The NTF occasionally uses stolen Watchdogs to guard supply depots or minor installations."

3065, "Until the advent of the GTSG Alastor, the GTSG Cerberus was the most advanced sentry gun emplacement available to Terran forces. They were vital to Terran defenses during the Great War, racking up over 100 kills of Vasudan and Shivan combat craft. But the current conflict has found them primarily in back-line roles, guarding installations deemed relatively safe from attack. With no mobility and only two Subach HL-7 turrets, they serve as more of a distraction than a viable threat to modern combat craft."

3066, "GTSG Alastor sentry gun platforms can be dropped by warships to cover a retreat, or they can be used to strengthen firepower around strategic locations.  While Alastors alone cannot hold a position against more than a few fighters, complementing them with a warship and several wings of fighters presents an exemplary defense against all but the most determined foes. Two Bessmer-Kohn cannon turrets on opposing sides of the platform give the Alastor a full field of fire. The turrets are controlled by the latest neural-net cyber-AI to track multiple targets simultaneously."

3067, "The GTEP Hermes escape pod is now standard equipment on every GTVA warship of cruiser size or larger. Each ship has several escape pods magnetically coupled to airlocks scattered around the ship's outer hull. Not intended for whole-crew evacuations, the Hermes has space for up to 20 crew members. Each pod is propelled by a small fusion engine, enough to remove the pod from the immediate vicinity of an exploding warship. It is also capable of subspace jumps."

Despite having only two primary and secondary weapon banks, the Serapis has been retrofitted to accommodate almost any loadout in the GTVA arsenal. Veteran Vasudan pilots love the Serapis for its agility and loadout options. Some Terran pilots who've been privileged enough to fly it claim to prefer it to any Terran fighter."

3098, "The GVF Tauret is replacing the Seth as the Vasudans' heavy assault fighter. While integrating cutting-edge technology developed in collaboration with the Terrans, the Tauret boasts a distinctly Vasudan design. Its unusual configuration was inspired by the Apsu-Hek, a creature that once inhabited the deserts of Vasuda Prime. The Apsu-Hek has become an emblem of the Vasudan diaspora, and the Tauret continues the tradition of symbolic design. Armed with four gun mounts and two missile banks, the Tauret has the speed and firepower to challenge both fighters and warships."

The version currently in use was further modified by technicians at Mekhu Enterprises. Sporting four primary weapon banks and three missile/bomb bays, the Sekhmet packs a massive punch. Add in a top speed that surpasses that of some fighters and an ultra-dense molybdenum armor plating, and it's easy to see why the Sekhmet is the favorite bomber among Vasudan pilots."

It is showing its age during the current conflict, as the more advanced Bakha and Sekhmet bombers have replaced it on the front lines in most theatres of conflict. Osiris bombers still in service have been retrofitted to make them compatible with most GTVA missiles and bombs.

3116, "Learning a lesson from the bomber losses of the Great War, Vasudan defense contractor Akheton designed the GVB Bakha, a fast, agile bomber that could still deliver a warship-shattering payload. The Bakha's dual Akh-12 engines are baffled and masked, giving it a small profile for heat-seeking missiles. The bomber's speed and maneuverability make it the craft of choice for taking out destroyers and corvettes with multiple flak, AAA, and anti-ship beam turrets. Over 6,000 Bakhas have been produced in the orbiting shipyards around Vasuda Prime."

3122, "The stealth prototype GVF Ptah was a top-secret development project assigned to Vasudan conglomerate Akheton Corp. Designed to be invisible to standard detection arrays mounted on combat craft, Ptahs have performed admirably during their OpEval period. The masking materials and blending technologies used across their outer surfaces seem to confuse Shivan detection systems as well. The Ptah is currently available only to select fighter units in the Vasudan navy, with no word on when they will be more widely distributed."

3123, "The GVS Nephtys is the Vasudans' new support ship. It is fast and maneuverable, a necessity when trying to dock with fighters in the heat of battle. Mekhu Enterprises built a cargo bay into the rear of the ship, enabling it to carry extra supplies and munitions during emergencies. Mekhu enterprises licensed the GTS Hygeia's magnetic-stasis delivery system from Triton Dynamics, so both ships are equally adept at re-supplying combat craft with missiles and bombs. The high number of warheads carried by the Nephtys makes it a dangerous ship to be near when it blows up."

3124, "The GVT Isis is most often used as a military personnel transport but also occasionally serves as a repair ship or even a tugboat, helping to maneuver large vessels into docking bays. Two cannon turrets and thick molybdenum plating serve to protect its cargo. Magnetic cargo locks located on the Isis's undercarriage enable it to transport small cargo containers of supplies and munitions in emergencies."

3125, "The Ma'at freighter class has served the Vasudan navy for over 50 years. More than 200 of these vessels still serve the GTVA, carrying desperately needed supplies, foodstuffs, and munitions to every theatre of the war. With only three weapon turrets, a lone Ma'at is easy prey for a wing of enemy bombers. Thus Ma'ats usually travel in mixed convoys with other freighters, guarded by cruisers and fighter wings."

3126, "For the past 20 years, the GVFr Bes has been the mainstay of Vasudan shipping fleets. While some Terran systems languished in the post-war era, the Vasudans experienced an economic recovery that was miraculous, given the annihilation of their home planet. Experts credit the policies of the restored Imperial government that emerged following Khonsu II's dissolution of the Vasudan parliament. As commerce among the Vasudan systems resumed and expanded into Terran worlds, a new generation of space-faring cargo vessels was required to meet the needs of this burgeoning economy."

3127, "The Vasudan VAC 5 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3128, "The Vasudan VAC 4 is an armored cargo container that is used to transport fragile or valuable equipment to front-line bases. These containers are better protected than most combat spacecraft, giving their cargoes an excellent chance to survive collisions and stray energy blasts."

3129, "When the first Satis-class freighter was encountered by Terran forces during the Terran-Vasudan War, its firepower led Terran Command to classify it as a light cruiser. Only after a disabled Satis was captured did its true nature become known. Now designated the GVFr Satis class, these freighters still serve as an iron fist within the velvet glove of a freighter convoy. Few enemy fighters who mistake a Satis for a Ma'at or Bes live to regret their error."

3130, "The GVG Anuket was originally designed for resource extraction in the volatile environment of gas giants. More recently, the Anuket has been modified for nebular operations. The Anuket has the most sophisticated sensor array available, enabling it to navigate the intense EM maelstroms of supernova remnants. In the nebula, the Anuket plays two important roles. First, the miner collects samples for scientific analysis and serves as a laboratory for field experiments. Second, the Anuket gathers deuterium-rich gas for use in the fusion drives that power the allied fleet."

3131, "The GVC Aten is among the smallest of the GTVA's cruiser classes, with thin armor and only a few, relatively weak turrets. Terran fighters and bombers exploited these weaknesses during the early years of the Great War, when the Terrans and Vasudans were still enemies. The Aten is most often seen in the current conflict as a rear-guard defense for convoys or installations, backing up wings of fighters and bombers."

3132, "The GVC Mentu cruiser is the lightest of the new Vasudan warships. Following the Great War, allied scientists developed the beam cannons that now serve as the primary armaments of today's GTVA warships. Rather than modify existing ships, the Vasudans developed new designs to mount these weapons. The Mentu's 16 turrets include heavy beam cannons for duking it out with other warships, as well as AAA and flak turrets to fend off smaller craft. The GVC Somtus and the GVC Mycerinus recently demonstrated the strength of the Mentu against NTF forces in Epsilon Pegasi."

3133, "Design of the corvette class GVCv Sobek began in the dark days after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Shivans in the Great War. The Vasudan navy wanted a vessel that could single-handedly counter powerful Shivan cruisers and provide critical support to Vasudan destroyers in battles against Shivan capital ships. The Sobek class fills those requirements admirably. Bristling with almost two dozen turrets, these corvettes are a terror to all vessels of cruiser size and below, while presenting a dire threat even to ships far larger than themselves."

3134, "The GVD Typhon was the height of Vasudan military technology when it appeared to face Terran forces during the early days of the Terran-Vasudan War. The first Typhon was sighted at the Vega Engagement and quickly destroyed the GTD Eisenhower and much of the 4th fleet. The more recent Hatshepsut class of destroyers is larger and wields a deadlier array of armaments, but the Typhon is still a match for almost any foe. Up to 30 wings of fighters or bombers can be housed within its docking bays, ready to engage at a moment's notice."

3135, "The GVSG Ankh sentry gun platform is the Vasudan equivalent of the GTSG Watchdog. Both are Great War relics that perform poorly by modern standards. The Ankh serves to guard back-line storage depots and installations. With no armor or shielding, the Ankh is easily destroyed. Its two small turrets can deter unarmed raiders or badly damaged fighters, but it poses little threat to most combat craft."

3136, "When the GTVA asked the Vasudan navy to upgrade the Great War-era Ankh sentry gun platform, the GVSG Edjo was the Vasudans' answer. The Edjo has significantly more armor plating than the Ankh, improving its survivability, but the Vasudans placed only one small cannon turret on the new platform, giving it half the punch of the Ankh. After seeing the Edjo, the Terrans quietly began developing their own advanced sentry gun platforms. The Vasudan navy seems content to leave this aspect of military technology to the Terrans."

3137, "The GVEP Ra escape pod has been the standard emergency vehicle on Vasudan capital ships since the Terran-Vasudan War. In keeping with Vasudan philosophies, the Ra is almost never used to evacuate personnel, but instead is employed to preserve records and other data that could be of use to the allies. Thus Ra-class craft have minimal life support systems and a small fusion engine. The energy supplied by the escape pod's powerplant goes almost entirely to powering the pod's homing beacon."

3138, "The GVA Setekh is the Vasudan class of AWACS vessels, comparable to the Terran GTA Charybdis class. Setekhs are smaller, less heavily armored, and have half the turrets of Charybdis ships. Despite these shortcomings, the Vasudan navy insists upon deploying Setekhs in Vasudan battle groups, claiming the Vasudan versions are more appropriate for their fleets. Setekhs' crystalline detection arrays provide their fleets with doubled radar range within the nebular region. Every Vasudan battle group operating in this theatre has a wing of Setekhs attached to it."

3139, "In 2360, Allied Command commissioned the first of the GVD Hatshepsut-class destroyers. The Vasudan contractor Akheton designed the Hatshepsut to efficiently integrate the new beam cannon. The process of retrofitting the older Typhon-class warships yielded vessels prone to system failures and reactor overloads. Though a handful of modified Typhons remain in service, the Hatshepsut has taken over as the primary Vasudan destroyer. With 24 turrets, 5 beam cannons, and 2 fighterbays, destroyers such as GVD Psamtik of Deneb's 13th Battle Group serve at the vanguard of the modern Vasudan fleet."

3140, "The Shivan fighter class SF Dragon is a fast, extremely agile craft. Its twin lasers pack a deadly punch. The Dragon's weakness seems to be a thin hull. The trouble is that their speed and maneuverability make them extremely difficult to hit."

3141, "The SF Basilisk is a Shivan heavy attack fighter. Slow but heavily armed and well-protected, the Basilisk targets slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3142, "The Manticore fighter is the fastest known craft in the Shivan armada. With a single, powerful laser and two missile banks, it is a dangerous offensive weapon. Its Achilles' heel lies in its thin hull and weak shields. Manticores do not last long in dogfights against other fighters. They prefer to target bombers, which are nearly helpless against the Manticore's speed and weaponry."

3143, "The SF Aeshma is a relatively rare, and only recently encountered, class of Shivan fighter. It appears to be a heavy attack fighter, like the Basilisk. With a low known top speed, Aeshmas seem to target slower-moving vessels, such as bombers, freighters, and gas miners. Their powerful lasers make them a danger to all such craft, so they must be engaged and destroyed as quickly as possible."

3144, "The SF Mara class of Shivan fighters was first encountered by the GTC Vigilant while patrolling the Gamma Draconis jump node in the Capella system. All other information concerning the Mara is classified level Psi."

3145, "First encountered in Gamma Draconis, the SF Astaroth is a fast, agile fighter that appears to have achieved its maneuverability at the expense of its armor and weaponry. Once the shields of an Astaroth are down, the fighter can be dispatched quickly."

3146, "The SB Nephilim is the slowest of the Shivan bomber classes. These craft were first encountered during the Great War and are still found in many Shivan attack formations. Nephilims are heavily armored and shielded, enabling them to deliver their devastating payloads despite their lack of speed."

3147, "The SB Taurvi is a Shivan vessel that has only recently been encountered. The Taurvi is one of the weaker Shivan bomber classes, but still the equal of every bomber in the GTVA arsenal. Not as maneuverable as a Nahema, nor as tough as a Seraphim or Nephilim, the Taurvi appears to be a Shivan compromise between speed and power."

3148, "Either the SB Nahema class is a new Shivan bomber design, or the Shivans are finally taking the GTVA seriously and bringing in their best ships. The Nahema is considered to be the Shivan's most dangerous bomber. It has demonstrated the ability to outrun virtually every fighter in the GTVA fleet. Its powerful laser banks and high-capacity missile bays make it a threat to combat craft of all types, as well as to capital ships."

3149, "The SB Seraphim is a familiar foe to GTVA forces. They appear to be similar to Nephilims in speed, armor, and shield strength, but have demonstrated a larger bomb capacity."

3150, "Encountered on rare occasions since the Shivans first entered the Great War, the ST Azrael is the only known class of Shivan transport. Little is known about it even now, but it is believed to house many Shivans within its thin hulls. Since Azraels might be carrying Shivan pilots or other skilled crew members, it is always worthwhile to eliminate these lightly defended ships."

3151, "The SFr Dis class of freighters is smaller than the Asmodeus class and not as well armed. It is still much more dangerous to attack than the GTVA's Triton or Poseidon freighters, however."

3152, "The SAC 3 is the most common Shivan cargo container found thus far. Its thin plating is barely enough to maintain the interior atmospheric integrity against the vacuum of space. As no additional effort was made to armor these containers against attack, it is assumed that only items of low value or importance are carried within. Nevertheless, standing orders are to capture these containers at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3153, "The SFr Mephisto class is equivalent to the Dis class in size and combat capabilities. Given their wildly different configurations, they must serve different purposes for the Shivans, but Allied Intelligence currently offers no further information on this matter."

3154, "The SC 5 class of Shivan cargo container is functionally identical to the SAC 3 class, as far as GTVA engineers have been able to determine. As with all Shivan cargo containers, standing orders are to capture at every opportunity, unless mission orders specifically dictate otherwise."

3155, "Little is known about the SFr Asmodeus line of freighters. With a strong hull and four weapon turrets, they are the most dangerous Shivan freighters to attack. Nothing is known of the cargo Asmodeus freighters commonly carry."

3156, "The SAC 2 is a heavily armored variant of the standard Shivan cargo container. Equipment found in captured SAC 2s appears to be more fragile than that found in the more common SAC 3s. SAC 2 cargo containers are to be captured rather than destroyed at every opportunity. If the choice is between destruction and allowing the container to be recovered by Shivan forces, pilots are authorized to destroy the container."

3157, "The SC Lilith class of Shivan cruisers is a far-deadlier foe than the Cain class. Nearly impenetrable armor plating enables it to withstand tremendous punishment, enabling its nine turrets to lash out at warships and combat spacecraft with impunity."

3158, "Though not as thickly armored as the Lilith class, the SC Rakshasa class of Shivan cruisers is far deadlier. With over a dozen turrets, the Rakshasa is the most heavily armed Shivan cruiser class. It was a Rakshasa cruiser that destroyed the GTC Vigilant at the Gamma Draconis node in the Capella system."

3159, "The weakest of the Shivan cruiser classes is designated SC Cain. These vessels were commonly encountered during Great War battles. Cains are considered to be slightly stronger than the GTC Fenris cruiser class."

3160, "The SD Demon class of Shivan destroyers is much smaller than the Lucifer class but very heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Demons are known to carry numerous wings of fighters and bombers."

3161, "The SD Ravana is a destroyer class GTVA forces have only recently encountered. It appears to be tasked with clearing out smaller foes, a mission for which it is well suited. It eagerly wipes out wings of fighters and bombers and also overwhelms cruisers and corvettes."

3162, "The SD Lucifer was a massive superdestroyer that led the Shivan armada in the Great War. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields. In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered ancient artifacts that explained how to track ships into subspace, where the Lucifer's shields would not function. A desperate mission to attack the Lucifer in subspace succeeded. But the explosion of the Lucifer collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact with Earth. The victory over the Lucifer effectively ended the Shivan invasion."

3163, "The SSG Trident line of sentry gun platforms is well known from numerous encounters during the Great War. These are still used to guard Shivan installations, but many of the stronger Belial platforms have been deployed to the most critical defensive positions."

3164, "The SSG Belial sentry gun platform appears to be a radical redesign of the Trident platform that was first encountered during the Great War. Pilots who have encountered both report that the Belial is harder to kill. It is reliably known that the Belial has twice as many laser turrets as the Trident sentry gun. Both types are used to guard storage depots, gas miners, and other Shivan installations."

3165, "Almost nothing is known of the Rahu line of gas miners. It is assumed that they function in much the same way as our Zephyrus miners, funneling nebular gas into internal machinery that fractionates it into its molecular components for further processing. Rahu miners are armed with heavy laser turrets, so care must be taken when attacking them."

3166, "Only one class of Shivan ship is classified as a corvette - the SCv Moloch class. Though they're physically as large as the GTCv Deimos class, Molochs do not seem to pack the same punch. They are far more deadly than any Shivan cruisers, however."

3167, "Very little is known about the SJ Sathanas class. This juggernaut seems comparable in strength to the GTVA Colossus.  All intelligence concerning the Sathanas has been classified level Upsilon."

3184, "The Great War"

3185, "In 2335, the Terran-Vasudan War entered its fourteenth year. The Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) and the Parliamentary Vasudan Navy (PVN) were both exhausted, demoralized, and on the verge of internal collapse. 

The invasion of a mysterious species, designated the Shivans, compelled Terran and Vasudan leaders to sign an armistice and form a new alliance. Using advanced weaponry and shields, the Shivans attacked without provocation and without warning. 

The allies acquired and developed new technologies to confront the menace. At the vanguard of the Shivan armada was the SD Lucifer, a massive superdestroyer. The Lucifer exterminated all life on Vasuda Prime and set course for Earth. No weapon in the allied arsenal could penetrate the Lucifer's shields.

In the Altair system, Vasudan scientists uncovered the ruins of an extinct civilization destroyed by the Shivans eight thousand years ago. The artifacts explained how to track the Lucifer into subspace where its shields would not function. In subspace, the Lucifer could be destroyed. 

>From the Delta Serpentis system, a squadron launched from the GTD Bastion pursued the Lucifer into the Sol jump node. These fighters and bombers had to destroy the Lucifer's reactors before the superdestroyer extinguished all life on Earth. 

According to declassified transmissions, the mission succeeded. However, the explosion of the Lucifer created a subspace cataclysm that collapsed the Sol jump node, severing all contact between Earth and the other systems of Terran-Vasudan space."

3186, "Reconstruction"

3187, "By the end of 2335, the Great War was over. The victory over the Lucifer had dealt the decisive blow. Incapable of coordinated strikes or strategic planning, the Shivans were outmaneuvered, isolated, and gradually destroyed. However, both species faced the challenge of rebuilding their interstellar societies from the ground up.

An ill-fated coup d'etat, orchestrated by the rogue intelligence branch of the GTA, marked the beginning of post-war factional politics. With its economy in ruins and political structures in turmoil, the Galactic Terran Alliance disintegrated into semi-autonomous regional blocs, each with its own agenda. The major entities included the Adhara Coalition, the Antares Federation, the Regulus Syndicate, and the Luyten New Alliance. As these groups consolidated and stabilized, the reconstruction gained momentum, and the resumption of open commerce rekindled the notion of a pan-Terran community.

Despite the annihilation of all life in their home system, the success of the Vasudan reconstruction surpassed that of their Terran allies. The Vasudans were governed by a Parliament until 2339, when the Vasudan Emperor, Khonsu II, dissolved this body and formed a new government, bringing an end to an institution notorious for its Byzantine treachery, corruption, and arrogance. The heir of a 10,000 year dynasty, Khonsu distinguished himself as a leader of unusual acumen and wisdom. Economists credit the Khonsu regime for the miraculous rehabilitation of Vasudan industry and society."

3188, "GTVA"

3189, "The Galactic Terran-Vasudan Alliance (GTVA) was formed in 2345, ten years after the Great War. This treaty organization recognized the autonomy of its constituents as it provided a framework for trade and mutual defense. The Great War had transformed the enmity between Terrans and Vasudans into a lasting fellowship.

As the industry and economy of the Terran-Vasudan systems recovered, support for a more powerful GTVA gained momentum. In 2358, delegates signed into existence the Beta Aquilae Convention (BETAC), named after the system where the constitution was drafted and ratified. BETAC dismantled the governments of the Terran blocs and recognized the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Vasudan Imperium as the supreme authorities of Terran-Vasudan space.

Under BETAC, the Vasudans and the Terrans maintain separate fleets under a single command structure. A warship is designated GT or GV, indicating whether it is Galactic Terran or Galactic Vasudan. The two species openly exchange information and technology, and the most recent fighters and bombers can be modified to accommodate pilots of either species.

Technically, BETAC is but one of a series of conventions and treaties that define how the GTVA functions as a political, military, and economic entity. However, the significance of BETAC as the cornerstone of the Terran-Vasudan alliance has made it the favored target of NTF propagandists."

3190, "Earth"

3191, "In 2335, the destruction of the Lucifer superdestroyer collapsed the Sol jump node in Delta Serpentis, severing all contact with Earth.

The fate of the Terran home planet remains open to speculation, though a number of scenarios are possible. As the center of an interstellar community, Earth could not survive in isolation without a radical transformation of its political and economic structures. On this point, there is no disagreement. However, the question remains whether this transition occurred peacefully or whether Terran society collapsed into anarchy. Strong arguments have been advanced for both sides.

For generations, Earth had been the political, economic, and cultural center of Terran civilization. Humans still measured time in hours, days, months, and years. They named their ships after the mythological figures of ancient Terran civilizations, and systems were still identified according to the constellations observed from Earth. The planet served as capital of the GTA, and the bulk of the Terran industrial base was located in the Sol system. Offworlders identified their nationality according to the old Earth boundaries, though nation-states dissolved after the discovery of subspace and the emergence of an interstellar Terran society.

Though necessity has diminished Earth's practical importance in the post-war era, discovering the means to return home remains a high priority."

3192, "Neo-Terran Front"

3193, "Eighteen months ago, Admiral Aken Bosch, commander of the GTVA 6th Fleet, launched a violent military coup in the Polaris system. Within weeks, a regional domino effect also toppled the governments of Regulus and Sirius, all swearing allegiance to Bosch and his Neo-Terran Front.

Bosch's vision of Neo-Terra informs the ideology of his movement. Though Terrans have lived in exile from Earth since the end of the Great War, Bosch imagined a utopia that would restore the grandeur of the lost world. As the people of Earth once relied on Polaris to help them navigate the seas, the North Star would become the spiritual and political compass for Terrans of the new era. Bosch's message had a profound impact on the so-called Lost Generation, born during the post-war Reconstruction. The Neo-Terran Front provided the youth of Polaris, Regulus, and Sirius with a cause to fight and die for.

Bosch succeeded because his pro-Terran ideology was explicitly anti-Vasudan. The NTF opposed any Terran-Vasudan alliance and called for the dissolution of the GTVA. The NTF core systems had suffered political and economic chaos throughout the post-war Reconstruction. The Vasudans' miraculous recovery under Khonsu II's leadership embittered those Terrans still struggling to rebuild their own systems. Bosch exploited this anti-Vasudan sentiment to achieve his own political ends."

3194, "Vasudans"

3195, "The Vasudans are a civilization of philosophers, artists, and scholars. They immerse themselves in the teachings of those who came before them, perceiving history not as a linear chronology of events but as a space inhabited by both the living and the dead.

To the Terran outsider, Vasudan society appears convoluted and ritualistic. The Vasudans themselves may seem arrogant, treacherous, and superstitious. On the other hand, Vasudans tend to view Terrans as aggressive, paranoid, and stupid. Thirty years of peaceful interaction between Terrans and Vasudans has helped to deconstruct these stereotypes.

The crowning achievement of the Vasudan civilization is its language. For the average Terran, the formalities governing its usage are beyond comprehension. Syntax and vocabulary are dictated by such factors as the speaker's age, rank, and caste, the time of day and the phase of the Vasudan calendar, and the relative spatial position of the speaker to the Emperor. This is further compounded by the existence of several alphabets, dozens of verb tenses, and thousands of dialects. A translation device is standard on all GTVA communications systems, enabling Terrans and Vasudans to understand each other.

Because the Vasudan homeworld was primarily desert, the Terrans used Egyptian names to designate Vasudan warships during the Terran-Vasudan War and the Great War. After the defeat of the Shivans, the Vasudans insisted on maintaining this convention. The Emperor strongly identified with the history of Ancient Egypt, particularly the longevity of its civilization. Following their Emperor's example, Vasudans will take on what they call a Terran name from the myths and history of Ancient Egypt."

3196, "Hammer of Light"

3197, "The dark side of the Vasudan obsession with history was the emergence during the Great War of Hammer of Light (HoL), a cult that gained a strong following among the PVN, resulting in defections to the HoL cause. The HoL believed the Shivans were the cosmic redeemers and destroyers predicted in obscure prophecies written thousands of years ago. Following the destruction of the Lucifer, the ideology and activities of Hammer of Light shifted.

While some followers committed ritual suicide, the military branch of the movement continued their armed opposition to the Vasudan government and its alliance with the Terrans. Though they continued to espouse HoL's religious dogma, their activities turned more toward acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare. This branch of the HoL was later crushed in Operation Templar, following the HoL's kidnapping of the Vasudan admiralty. Other HoL leaders vanished into obscurity, returning to the study of arcane texts. A number of these religious leaders were apprehended and imprisoned for their role in the insurgency, though a few are still in hiding."

3198, "Shivans"

3199, "32 years after the Great War, we still know almost nothing about the Shivans. 

Physically, the Shivans have multiple, compound eyes and five legs with claw-like manipulators. Their insect-like carapace does not appear original to the creature's physiognomy, suggesting the Shivans are a cybernetic fusion of biology and technology. The integrated plasma weapon also exhibits properties of an organic-artificial fusion. The weapon may be a kind of focusing device powered by the energy of the being itself, though this point is the subject of heated controversy.

These details are cited as evidence that the Shivans could not have evolved as the Terran or Vasudan species had, but that they were likely constructed by another entity. Only a handful of Shivans have ever been captured, and all research on live specimens ended with the GTI's Hades rebellion in 2335. The results of these studies remain highly classified.

Though the Shivans are obviously xenocidal, their motives and origins have yet to be determined. According to Ancient artifacts, the Shivans seem to possess some kind of sensitivity to subspace disturbances. We do not know if the Shivans returned to this corner of the galaxy by chance, by cycle or pattern, or by their detection of Terran-Vasudan subspace travel.  

Xenobiologists know very little about Shivan society. A leading hypothesis is the hive mind theory, arguing that Shivan society is broken down in specialized functions driven by a collective intelligence. The most convincing evidence supporting this theory is the behavior of Shivan forces following the destruction of the Lucifer, the turning point of the Great War. Other experts caution against attributing insectoid properties to the Shivans, regardless of their appearance and behavior. Shivan communication seems to occur in the electromagnetic spectrum, though efforts to decode their transmissions have yielded no meaningful results to date."

3200, "The Ancients"

3201, "During the Great War, as the annihilation of Earth seemed imminent, Vasudan scientists discovered the ruins of an extinct civilization we now call the Ancients. Data excavated at the site enabled the allies to track and destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace.

After the Great War, scientists uncovered more sites throughout Terran-Vasudan space. Though only fragments remain, this interstellar society thrived thousands of years ago. Their empire was more expansive than the current boundaries of known space, and archeologists believe they might eventually uncover a map of the Ancient nodes, enabling the Alliance to travel to systems previously uncharted. 

There is virtually no visual record of this civilization, except hieroglyphic forms discovered at the archeological sites and a handful of technological schematics. Major excavations are underway in Altair, Aldebaran, and Deneb, but the data gathered there remains classified at the highest level. 

Terran archeologists use a Minoan naming convention to identify sites and major artifacts. Current evidence suggests the Shivans exterminated this civilization over eight thousand years ago. The Ancients believed the Shivans were a race of cosmic destroyers, and that the extinction of their species was an act of retribution for striving beyond their ordained place in the cosmic order."

3202, "Subspace"

3203, "In simple terms, subspace is an n-dimensional tunnel between one point in the universe and another. A vessel can travel through this tunnel in a matter of minutes, making a journey that might otherwise take decades or even centuries at light speed.

A jump drive causes a ship to vibrate in multiple dimensions until its modulations are in perfect synchronization with the subspace continuum. A vortex opens, creating an aperture from an infinitesimally small point in the cosmos, enabling the vessel to cross the subspace threshold. 

Two types of jumps are possible. 

First, an intrasystem jump can occur between two points in a star system. Most small, space-faring vessels are equipped with motivators capable of these short jumps. The presence of an intense gravitational field is required, prohibiting travel beyond the boundaries of a star system.

Second, ships can jump from system to system via nodes. Until the Great War, only larger ships could generate sufficient power to use jump nodes. The development of jump drives for fighters and bombers in 2335 enabled the Alliance to destroy the SD Lucifer in subspace. Producing these small jump drives is prohibitively expensive, so they are restricted to missions that require pilots to travel between systems. The Head-Up Display indicates the location of jump nodes with a green sphere.

The vast majority of subspace nodes are extremely unstable, forming and dissipating in nanoseconds. Other nodes have a longer lifespan, existing for centuries or millennia before collapsing. The jump nodes sanctioned by the GTVA for interstellar travel are expected to remain stable for many years."

3394, "GTM-13 Helios"

3395, "The GTM-13 Helios is the product of an entire generation of high-energy physics research, based primarily at the GTVA particle accelerator complex near Antares. The most powerful warhead in the fleet's arsenal, the Helios generates a massive shockwave from the cataclysmic annihilation of matter and anti-matter, triggered upon impact with its target. Each bank of Helios warheads can fire only once every 30 seconds. The Helios is prohibitively expensive to produce, thus its deployment is severely restricted."

3396, "GTM-14 EMP Adv."

3397, "Advanced Missile
Electromagnetic Pulse Weapon
General Purpose Suppression"

3398, "GTM-14 EM Pulse Adv."

3399, "The GTM-14 Electromagnetic Pulse Advanced warhead interferes with the electronics systems of vessels caught within its blast radius. This renders the affected ships unable to track targets, manage communications, or gain aspect missile lock. Tactically, the GTM-14 is a very effective anti-bomber weapon, as it also temporarily shuts down the guidance and propulsion systems of warheads in flight. This advanced version of the standard EM Pulse missile disrupts subsystems at a deeper circuitry level, resulting in a longer-lasting effect."

3400, "GTM MX-52"

3401, "Standard Issue
Fire and Forget"

3402, "GTM MX-52

Suitable for all space battles - defensive and offensive - medium payload (16.5 Kt) - infrared tracking and semi-intelligent targeting - pilot chooses desired target, and the MX-50 tracks the chosen target based off the emission of heat from the - engine, the weapon bays, and the cockpit of the target ship - the MX-50 will always attack a target that is determined to be hostile by the onboard computer of any GTA combat vessel, thus ensuring a higher kill rate, should the pilot find himself in a heated battle situation where precise aiming might be difficult.

Early experiments with energy based defenses like the deflector array at Ross 128 have shown that this weapon is exceedingly weak against anything besides steel based targets."

                                 ---------------------------------------------------------

Mit Hilfe des Launcher-Menüs können Sie FreeSpace 2
starten und an Ihre Hardware anpassen können, neue
Versionen des Spiels herunterladen und die FreeSpace 2
Homepages im World Wide Web aufrufen. Hier eine kurze
Beschreibung für jeden Auswahlpunkt:


SPIELEN
  Startet das Spiel FreeSpace 2


SETUP
  Öffnet den Setup-Dialog, der wiederum in Grafik, Audio, Joystick,
Geschwindigkeit, Netzwerk, DirectX und Sonstiges eingeteilt ist.
"

3404, "
  * Grafik - Sie müssen eine 3D-Grafikkarte besitzen, um FreeSpace 2
spielen zu können. Sie können das Spiel nach Glide- und Direct3D-
kompatiblen Karten suchen lassen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im Interlaced-Modus abspielen' - Hierbei werden die
Bilder in zwei Durchgängen gezeichnet, damit langsamere Grafikkarten
damit zurechtkommen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im FastClear-Modus abspielen' - Durch FastClear
werden die Einzelbilder der Animationen direkt aufeinandergezeichnet,
ohne dazwischen den Bildschirm zu löschen. Das kann auf manchen Karten
einige Flackereffekte verhindern.
     - 'Niedrige Direct3D-Texturdetails' beschleunigt das Spiel, indem
weniger Texturdetails verwendet werden, was natürlich dann in einer
schlechteren Grafik resultiert. Deswegen sollten Sie diese Option nur
dann aktivieren, wenn Sie während das Spiel oft stockt oder langsam
läuft.
     - 'WFOG erzwingen' - WFOG, eine Direct3D-Option, ist eine alter-
native Art, Nebeleffekte anzuzeigen (durch feste Tabellen statt
mit Vektorangaben). Manche Karten unterstützen WFOG nicht korrekt 
(z.B. die S4-Karte), deswegen ist die Option normalerweise deaktiviert.
Sie können aber gerne damit experimentieren.
     - 'Direct3D ZBuffer Bias deaktivieren' - Wenn Sie Direct3D
verwenden und Probleme beim Rendern der Geschwader-Logos sehen (die 
Logos überdecken alles andere), sollte diese Option den Fehler beheben.
"

3405, "
  * Audio - FreeSpace 2 unterstützt DirectSound, A3D und EAX. Sie können
einen dieser Standards auswählen, nachdem Sie auf 'Verfügbare Soundkarten
suchen' klicken und dann die gewünschte Soundkarte in der Liste
aussuchen. Ausserdem können Sie die Soundeffekte des Launchers hier ein-
und ausschalten.

  * Joystick - Hier können Sie Ihren Joystick für FreeSpace 2 einstellen.
Wenn Ihr Joystick Force Feedback unterstützt, kompatibel zu DirectX 6.0,
können Sie diese Option hier aktivieren.

  * Geschwindigkeit - Hier stellen Sie die Detailoptionen
für neue Piloten ein. Wir möchten darauf hinweisen, dass die 
Spielgeschwindigkeit deutlich beeinträchtigt werden kann, wenn Sie
diese Option höher als empfohlen setzen.

  * Netzwerk - Hier stellen Sie die Eigenschaften Ihrer Netzwerkhardware
ein, wie Geschwindigkeit und Art der Internetverbindung (falls
vorhanden). Sie können ausserdem hier Ihr PXO-Login eingeben, falls Sie 
sich bei diesem Internetservice eingetragen haben, oder einen
anderen Port erzwingen (Standard: 7808). Die 'PXO Banner' beziehen sich
auf den PXO-Chatscreen und zeigen, wenn aktiviert, Banner von guten
FreeSpace 2-Webseiten an.

  * DirectX - Hier wird Ihre DirectX-Version getestet. Es wird Ihnen
auch die Möglichkeit geboten, von hier aus DirectX zu installieren oder
zu aktualisieren.

  * Sonstiges - Hier können Sie sich noch die Sprache für das Spiel 
aussuchen. Einen Überblick über die möglichen Startparameter, die Sie 
in der Befehlszeile eingeben können, finden Sie in der README.TXT-Datei.

Dazu kann auch das eine oder andere Grosskampfschiff gehören, also nehmen Sie besser einen Bomber mit in Ihrer Staffel."

8, "Es wird nicht erwartet, dass Sie alle diese Kampfsimulation überleben. Ihr Ziel ist es vielmehr, so viele Gegner wie möglich auszuschalten, und dazu müssen Sie so lange am Leben bleiben wie möglich. Es wird allerdings erwartet, dass Sie bei dieser Simulation jedesmal etwas besser abschneiden als beim letzten Mal. Mit genug Übung sollten Sie sie eines Tages komplett überstehen können.

44, "Rebellen & Renegaten"

45, "Snipen und Alpha 1 müssen die Iceni scannen, während sie das Rebellen-Flaggschiff nach regulus eskortieren."

46, "Sondereinsatzkommando 

Sie haben sich freiwillig für einen Geheimeinsatz zum Sondereinsatzkommando (SEK) gemeldet, in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Nachrichtendienst (GTVN). Unser Hauptziel ist es, der Allianz genaue und umfassende Informationen über die Taktik, Technologie, Aktivitäten und strategischen Ziele aller Kräfte zu liefern, die der GTVA feindlich gesonnen sind."

47, "Ihr Auftrag

Die Missionen des Sondereinsatzkommandos werden weit hinter den feindlichen Linien durchgeführt, mit einem Minimum an logistischer Versorgung. Zu unseren Aktivitäten auf feindlichem Gebiet gehören Infiltration, Sabotage, gezielte Anschläge und das Sammeln von Informationen. 

Sie werden als Agent in die Neo-Terranische Front eingeschleust, als Staffelführer der Staffel Alpha des 185. Jägergeschwaders."

48, "Lt. Commander Snipes 

Ihr Kontaktmann bei diesem Auftrag ist Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes, ein alliierter Offizier, der vor sechs Monaten zur NTF 'desertiert' ist. Als Geschwaderführer des 185. wird Snipes Ihnen Ihre Ziele sowohl als NTF-Pilot als auch als alliierter Agent zuteilen. 

Sie werden mit einem Gerät ausgestattet, das es Ihnen erlaubt, während eines Gefechts mit Snipes über eine abhörsichere Frequenz zu kommunizieren. Die NTF-Schiffe werden diese Übertragungen als Zieldaten interpretieren."

49, "Das ETAK-Projekt 

Ziel unserer verdeckten Ermittlungen ist das ETAK-Projekt der NTF. Da nur die höchsten Dienstränge Zugriff auf diese Daten haben, ist unser Wissen über dieses Projekt sehr lückenhaft. ETAK befasst sich mit der Entwicklung einer neuen, richtungsweisenden Technologie, wahrscheinlich einer Massenvernichtungswaffe. 

Admiral Bosch leitet das Projekt persönlich, und die Rebellen bauen einen Prototypen auf seinem Kommandoschiff ein, der Iceni. Wir müssen uns diese Sache näher ansehen. Selbst eine Scanner-Abtastung der Iceni wäre schon eine wertvolle Hilfe."

50, "Eine letzte Warnung

Bei diesem Unternehmen arbeiten wir eng mit dem Vasudanischen Taktischen Befehlsstab und der terranischen 6. Flotte zusammen. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Sie gegen alliierte Jäger kämpfen müssen, ist sehr gering. Sollten Sie jedoch wirklich von Alliierten angegriffen werden, haben Sie die begrenzte Erlaubnis, das Feuer zu erwidern, aber nur zur Selbstverteidigung oder um die von Lieutenant Commander Snipes festgelegten Ziele zu erreichen. 

Halten Sie sich auf jeden Fall zurück, und beurteilen Sie die Lage nach Ihrem Ermessen."

51, "Hier spricht Lieutenant Commander Snipes. Ich möchte alle neuen Piloten beim 185. willkommen heissen. Wie Sie wissen, hat die Niederlage von Admiral Koth in Epsilon Pegasi das Polaris-System für alliierte Angriffe verwundbar gemacht. Um 14.25 Standardzeit haben vorgeschobene Kräfte der GTVA unsere Blockade am Sprungknoten durchbrochen. Die Colossus wird nicht lange auf sich warten lassen."

52, "Bosch geht kein Risiko ein. Wir ziehen das Befehlsschiff Iceni ins Regulus-System zurück, wo Bosch den Sitz seiner provisorischen Regierung einrichten will. Wir haben dieses Manöver ja schon mehrfach durchgezogen, Piloten. Alpha- und Beta-Staffel geben der Iceni Geleitschutz zum Sprungknoten. Delta, Sie bleiben als Eingreifreserve in Bereitschaft,"

53, "Der Regulus-Knoten liegt mitten in einem kleinen Asteroidenfeld. Unsere Aufgabe ist es, eine Schneise freizuräumen. Asteroiden auf Kollisionskurs mit der Iceni sind in Ihrem HUD durch weisse Klammern gekennzeichnet, damit Sie auch wissen, worauf Sie schiessen müssen. Die Kanoniere der Iceni werden uns unterstützen, es sollte also nicht allzu anstrengend werden."

54, "In Ordnung, Pilot, ich habe ein paar gute und ein paar schlechte Nachrichten. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass wir die Iceni und die Hinton nach Regulus schaffen konnten. Die Daten Ihres Scanners wurden an den GTVN übertragen, und unsere Operation zur Enthüllung des geheimnisvollen ETAK-Projektes geht weiter wie geplant.

Die schlechte Nachricht ist, dass wir in grösserer Gefahr sind, als Ihnen wahrscheinlich klar ist. Die vasudanischen Kriegsschiffe standen unter dem Befehl von Admiral Ahmose, der über unsere Aktivitäten im Bilde war. Die Tatsache, dass die Vasudaner den exakten Zeitpunkt und Ort kannten, an dem die Iceni abfliegen sollte, hat die Rebellen etwas misstrauisch gemacht. 

Wie üblich übertreibt der GTVA mal wieder. Ahmose und sein Befehlsstab sollen jetzt wegen Befehlsverweigerung vor ein Kriegsgericht gestellt werden. Die Rebellen sind da natürlich ganz hellhörig geworden: Der Admiral kannte nicht nur die Position der Iceni, sondern es war ihm auch noch verboten, diese Information auszunutzen. Damit steht unser Geschwader bei der NTF ziemlich weit oben auf der Liste der Verdächtigen. Und noch etwas: Die Piloten unter Ahmoses Befehl waren über seinen Renegaten-Status informiert worden, bevor sie den Angriff flogen. Unter diesen Umständen konnten wir nur das Feuer erwidern oder unsere Tarnung auffliegen lassen.

Passen Sie auf sich auf, Pilot. Das alles hier wird dadurch nicht leichter."

55, "In Ordnung, Pilot, ich habe ein paar gute und ein paar schlechte Nachrichten. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass wir die Iceni zur Hölle geschickt haben, zusammen mit Bosch und dem ETAK-Projekt - was immer das gewesen sein mag. 

Die schlechte Nachricht ist, dass die alliierten Kriegsschiffe, die die Iceni angegriffen haben, unter dem Befehl von Admiral Ahmose standen, der über unsere Aktivitäten im Bilde war. Die Tatsache, dass die Vasudaner den exakten Zeitpunkt und Ort kannten, an dem die Iceni abfliegen sollte, hat die Rebellen etwas misstrauisch gemacht. Die Spionageabwehr hat die Akten aller neuen Piloten erneut überprüft und in Ihren Unterlagen ein paar Unstimmigkeiten entdeckt. 

Als Ihr Vorgesetzter ist es meine Pflicht, Ihnen mitzuteilen, dass Sie um 21.00 Standardzeit wegen Spionage und Hochverrates hingerichtet werden. Schade, dass es so enden musste, Pilot."

56, "Sie hatten keine Erlaubnis, zum Stützpunkt zurückzukehren, Pilot. Ihre Handlungsweise hat nicht nur das Leben all derer gefährdet, die an diesem Einsatz beteiligt waren, sondern auch die Ziele der NTF in diesem Einsatzgebiet. Sofern das Oberkommando keine anderslautende Entscheidung trifft, werden Ihnen hiermit neben Ihrer Flugerlaubnis auch alle Rechte und Privilegien eines Offiziers der NTF aberkannt. Bis zu Ihrer Exekution um 21.00 werden Sie in der Arrestzelle in Gewahrsam genommen."

57, "In Ordnung, Pilot, ich habe ein paar gute und ein paar schlechte Nachrichten. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass wir die Iceni nach Regulus schaffen konnten. Die Daten Ihres Scanners wurden an den GTVN übertragen, und unsere Operation zur Enthüllung des geheimnisvollen ETAK-Projektes geht weiter wie geplant.

74, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten. Admiral Bosch und die Iceni haben das Regulus-System erreicht. Also, zurück zur Basis."

75, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot. Man weiss nie, was man findet, wenn man nicht nachschaut."

76, "Wir haben Neuigkeiten von der Epsilon-Pegasi-Blockade! Weitere vasudanische Kriegsschiffe sind unterwegs! Die Iceni wird wie geplant zum Regulus-Knoten weiterfliegen!"

78, "Alpha 1, empfangen Sie mich? Wir sprechen hier über einen sicheren Kanal. Wir brauchen eine Abtastung der Iceni. Erfassen Sie das Kriegsschiff als Ziel und nähern Sie sich ihm auf 600 Meter. Halten Sie den Vorhaltekreis des Schiffs in Ihrem Fadenkreuz."

79, "Was macht denn der Forschungskreuzer hier draussen? Davon hat mir das NTF-Oberkommando nie etwas gesagt. Muss irgendwas mit elektronischer Kriegsführung zu tun haben."

80, "Piloten, Sie müssen eine Schneise für die Iceni freischiessen. Zerstören Sie die Asteroiden, bevor sie mit dem Kommandoschiff kollidieren können. Asteroiden auf Kollisionskurs werden auf Ihrem HUD mit weissen Klammern markiert."

81, "Das ist komisch. Ich habe keine Ahnung, was das bedeutet. Mal sehen, was unsere Analytiker zu Hause damit anfangen können."

82, "Irgendwas stimmt hier nicht. Command sagte, die Vasudaner würden nicht angreifen, bevor die Iceni Polaris verlässt!"

83, "In Ordnung, so lauten die Spielregeln: Schiessen Sie alles ab, was die Iceni angreift. Schalten Sie Geschütztürme aus und fangen Sie Bomben ab."

84, "Die Vasudaner haben die Hinton vernichtet! Piloten, verdoppeln Sie Ihre Anstrengungen! Die Iceni muss ins Regulus-System gelangen!"

85, "Entweder wurden wir reingelegt, oder die Vasudaner halten sich nicht an ihre Befehle. Jetzt heisst es 'sie oder wir', Pilot."

86, "Wenn man auf Sie schiesst, schiessen Sie zurück. Wenn Sie sich nicht verteidigen, werden Sie hier draussen sterben, Alpha 1. Diese Vasudaner sind Abtrünnige!"

87, "Verdammt, Piloten! Wir haben die Iceni verloren! Einsatz abbrechen, zurück zum Stützpunkt!"

88, "Liebe den Verrat..."

89, "Snipen und Alpha 1 müssen die NTT Sunder kapern."

90, "Wie Sie zweifellos schon gehört haben, hat die GVD Psamtik die NTD Cyrene vernichtet, das Flaggschiff der Sirius-Flotte. So schlimm es auch in Polaris aussieht, die Situation am Sirius ist noch schlimmer. Bosch hat unseren Kampfverband abgezogen, um damit die NTF-Stellung in diesem System zu verstärken."

91, "Wir werden in sechs Stunden am Sirius ankommen. Das 185. wird sofort ausschwärmen, um sich mit der NTT Sunder zu treffen. Unser Auftrag lautet, dem Transporter Geleitschutz zurück zum Regulus-Sprungknoten zu geben. Die Fracht an Bord der Sunder wurde als so top secret eingestuft, dass selbst mir noch ein paar Geheimhaltungsstufen fehlen. Also sagen wir mal, wenn die Sunder hinüber ist, sind wir es auch."

92, "Die Allianz kämpft an zwei Fronten, um die Alpha-Centauri und Deneb-Sprungknoten zu sichern, daher schätzt der Geheimdienst das Risiko eines Zusammenstosses mit gegnerischen Kräften als gering ein. Andererseits haben sie uns auch genau das bei Polaris erzählt, wo wir dann plötzlich die halbe vasudanische Armada im Pelz hatten. Rechnen Sie mit den Unerwarteten, Junge, und melden Sie sich um exakt 13.10 auf dem Flugdeck. Weggetreten."

93, "Dank unseres Doppelspiels ist die Sunder jetzt in alliiertem Gewahrsam. Mit unseren Scannerdaten von der Iceni und dem gekaperten Rebellen-Transporter kann der GTVN jetzt anfangen, das Rätsel um Boschs ETAK-Projekt zu lösen. 

Der Kommandant der Sevrin hat Boschs gesammelten Zorn wegen der angeblichen Zerstörung der Sunder abbekommen. Der Kapitän und seine Offiziere wurden gemeinsam vor das Kriegsgericht gestellt und werden heuten um 07.00 exekutiert. Das hat man davon, wenn man bei der falschen Truppe anheuert. 

Aber das heisst nicht, dass wir schon über den Berg sind. Die Rebellen sind verrückt, aber nicht langsam. Sie werden nicht lange brauchen, um zu merken, dass unsere Rolle in dieser Sache und der vasudanische Hinterhalt in Polaris mehr als reiner Zufall sind. Wenn es so aussieht, als seien sie Ihnen auf die Schliche gekommen, ist es Ihre Pflicht als Agent des GTVN, zu fliehen und den alliierten Truppen alles mitzuteilen, was Sie erfahren haben. Verstanden?"

94, "Dank unseres Doppelspiels ist die Sunder jetzt in alliiertem Gewahrsam. Mit unseren Scannerdaten von der Iceni und dem gekaperten Rebellen-Transporter kann der GTVN jetzt anfangen, das Rätsel um Boschs ETAK-Projekt zu lösen. 

Die Zerstörung der Hamaka hat uns zum Handeln gezwungen. Die Rebellen wissen jetzt, dass wir vollwertige Mitglieder des noblen Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Nachrichtendienstes sind. Soweit es mich betrifft, haben wir alle Ziele dieser Geheimdienstaktion erreicht. Die Rebellen hätten nicht mehr lange gebraucht, um zu merken, dass unsere Rolle in dieser Sache und der vasudanische Hinterhalt in Polaris mehr als reiner Zufall sind. 

Wir bringen Sie nach Deneb, von wo aus Sie einen Transporter zurück nach Capella erwischen können. Dort melden Sie sich auf der Aquitaine zurück und holen sich einen neuen Auftrag ab. Es war mir eine Ehre, mit Ihnen zu arbeiten, Pilot. Viel Glück!"

95, "Sie können erst dann mit dem nächsten GTVN-Einsatz weitermachen, wenn die Hamako und die Sunder überleben."

96, "Mit der Zerstörung der Sunder ist unser Doppelspiel fehlgeschlagen. Allein mit unseren Scannerdaten von der Iceni wird es dem GTVN schwerfallen, das Rätsel um Boschs ETAK-Projekt zu lösen. Wir haben sechs Monate in diese Operation gesteckt und stehen jetzt doch mit leeren Händen da. 

Wir bringen Sie nach Deneb, von wo aus Sie einen Transporter zurück nach Capella erwischen können. Dort melden Sie sich auf der Aquitaine zurück und holen sich einen neuen Auftrag ab. Tut mir leid, dass Ihr Ausflug zum GTVN nicht erfolgreicher endet, Pilot. Sie waren wirklich vielversprechend."

111, "Diese Detonatoren waren Mist. Dabei habe ich mich sogar an die Gebrauchsanleitung gehalten. Zumindest habe wir schnell aufgeräumt. Spione wie wir nennen das 'klären'."

112, "Die Störsender hätten alle Übertragungen zum Rebellen-Oberkommando verhindern sollen. Aber bei unserem Glück erscheint hier gleich die NTF-Armada."

113, "Mayday! Mayday! Reaktorkernschäden an allen Jägern! Das halbe Geschwader ist ausgefallen!"

114, "Command, empfangen Sie mich? Wir sind reingelegt worden! Alpha 1 und Beta 1 sind Verräter! Wir sind sabotiert worden!"

115, "Ganz ruhig, Piloten. Wir haben eine verstümmelte Übertragung empfangen, irgendwas über Reaktorkernschäden. Was ist mit Ihrem Geschwader passiert?"

116, "Wir sind in den Hinterhalt eines schweren Aufklärungsgeschwaders geraten, die einen neuen Jägertyp flogen. Sie haben meine Staffel abgeschossen und sind dann sofort gesprungen, bevor wir reagieren konnten."

117, "Ein neuer Jägertyp? Sie können uns bei der Einsatznachbesprechung alles darüber erzählen. Sie sollten jetzt neue Munition fassen und ein paar Schäden beseitigen lassen, damit Sie den Geleitschutz zu Ende bringen können."

118, "Ein Teil dieser Übertragung ist durchgekommen. Ich weiss nicht, ob sie uns durchschaut haben oder nicht. Spielen wir erstmal weiter ihr Spiel. Ein paar Freunde von mir sind schon unterwegs, keine Panik."

119, "Unser Auftrag, Alpha 1, lautet, die NTT Sunder zu kapern. Der Pilot des Transporters ist einer von uns, daher wird er unserem Kurs folgen. Wir müssen die Rebellen glauben machen, dass die Sunder zerstört worden ist. Ein Köder-Transporter wird daher in ein paar Minuten hier eintreffen."

120, "Es ist noch mehr Verstärkung unterwegs, Alpha und Beta. Sie müssen nur noch ein paar Minuten durchhalten."

122, "Alpha 1, darf ich vorstellen: Das 99. Totenschädelgeschwader, Sondereinsatzkommando. Die Elite der Elite. Diese Jäger, die die Jungs fliegen, gehören zur Erinyes-Klasse. Von deren Existenz hat sonst niemand auch nur eine Ahnung."

123, "Wir setzen jetzt diesen getürkten Transporter ab. Wenn die Rebellen glauben, wir hätten die Sunder vernichtet, wissen sie nicht, wieviel wir wissen. Dann können wir auch unsere Geheimoperation fortsetzen."

124, "Natürlich nur, wenn sie uns nicht aufhängen, weil wir bei diesem Einsatz versagt haben. Vielleicht riskieren wir ja ein bisschen viel, aber was soll's..."

125, "Hier spricht die NTCv Sevrin, 2. Kampfgruppe, Regulus. Wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus, Piloten? Wir haben Anweisung, uns mit einem Transporter zu treffen."

126, "Sevrin, Sie kommen zu spät! Die Vasudaner haben mein gesamtes Geschwader und zwei Kreuzer hier draussen zerblasen! Sie wollen jemanden abholen? Dann scannen Sie gefälligst das Trümmerfeld! Das da drüben ist die Sunder! Sie sind eine Schande für die ganze NTF, Sevrin! Ich werde Sie melden!"

127, "Ganz ruhig, Beta 1. Wir haben unsere Befehle buchstabengetreu befolgt. Fliegen Sie jetzt zurück zur Basis, bevor die Vasudaner zurückkommen. Hier draussen können wir nichts mehr tun."

128, "Sehen Sie die Hamako da drüben? Das ist das neue AWACS-Schiff. Wir benutzen sie, um alle gegnerischen Funkübertragungen zu blockieren. Solange das Schiff einsatzbereit bleibt, erfährt niemand draussen, was wir vorhaben. Soweit es die NTF betrifft, sind wir immer noch loyale und ergebene Piloten."

129, "Also passen Sie auf die Hamako auf, in Ordnung? Wenn wir das AWACS-Schiff verlieren, ist unsere Tarnung im Eimer."

130, "Haltet die Augen auf, Jungs, wir sind fast da. Aber wenn dieses Transporter-Double hier nicht bald auftaucht, müssen wir alles abbrechen."

131, "Die Sunder schafft es nicht! Alle Einheiten, zurück zum Stützpunkt. Das hier haben wir fürchterlich in den Sand gesetzt."

132, "Die NTC Mylae ist gerade angekommen. Passen Sie auf die Flak auf!"

133, "Guter Schuss. Die Mylae ist unschädlich gemacht."

134, "Hier kommt die Hellespont, Aeolus-Klasse."

135, "Wir haben die Hellespont ausgeschaltet. Gut gemacht, Leute."

136, "Okay, die Naxos kommt rein, mitsamt unserem doppelten Lottchen. Ist auch langsam Zeit, dass Ihr Jungs Euch blicken lasst! Sichern wir die Gegend, und dann ab nach Hause."

137, "In Ordnung, Alpha 1. Jetzt brauchen wir nur noch auf die NTF zu warten. Position halten."

138, "...doch hasse den Verräter"

139, "Alpha 1 und das 185. greifen ein GTVA-Nachschubdepot an"

140, "Ich bin Lieutenant Commander Jack Niven, Ihr neuer Geschwaderführer. Commander Snipes wurde versetzt, daher werden Sie Ihre Anweisungen bis auf weiteres von mir bekommen. Der 13. und der 11. Vasudanische Kampfverband kommen auf uns zu, also werden wir einen schweren Kampf zu bestehen haben. Wenn wir Sirius verlieren, stehen wir mit dem Rücken zur Wand. Die NTF hat zu hart gekämpft, um jetzt aufzugeben."

141, "Die auf Vega stationierte 4. Flotte ist für die Versorgung der Vasudaner zuständig. Sie hat ein Frachtdepot in der Nähe des Alpha-Centauri-Sprungknotens eingerichtet. Unsere Aufklärer haben 16 Sperrgeschütze als Verteidigungsring gezählt, in regelmässigen Abständen von einer Jägerpatrouille überwacht. Das 185. hat die Aufgabe, diesen Nachschub abzuschneiden. Alle Ziele sind terranische Konstruktionen."

142, "Unser Angriff liegt vom Timing her genau zwischen den Jägerpatrouillen. Unser Ziel ist die Zerstörung aller Frachtbehälter und Sperrgeschütze. Sobald wir das Gebiet gesichert haben, sind wir in einer guten Position, um einen Hinterhalt für alliierte Ziele zu legen. Der Angriff sollte viele Gegner zu dem Depot locken und damit unsere Chancen bei Gefechten tiefer im System verbessern."

143, "Wir haben Glück, dass wir Sie lebend zurückbekommen haben, Pilot. Unsere Agenten vor Ort haben den Bordcomputer Ihres Jägers mit entscheidenden Daten vollgestopft. Dank dieser Informationen werden die Analytiker des GTVN das Rätsel um Boschs ETAK-Projekt wohl lösen können.

Diese Agenten waren es auch, die uns über Ihre bevorstehende Exekution informiert haben. Leider haben wir keine Hinweise darauf, wo Lieutenant Commander Snipes steckt oder wie es ihm geht. Wir fürchten das Schlimmste.

In Anerkennung Ihrer herausragenden Dienste für den Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Nachrichtendienst und das Sondereinsatzkommando verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit das Geheimdienstkreuz am Bande. Diese Auszeichnung dürfen nur wenige Auserwählte tragen. 

Wir werden Sie bis zur Vega mitnehmen, da wartet ein Transporter auf Sie, der Sie zur Capella zurückbringt. Sie melden sich wieder auf der Aquitaine, wo Sie auch Ihren nächsten Einsatzbefehl erhalten. Herzlichen Glückwunsch zu Ihrem erfolgreichen Abstecher zum GTVN."

144, "Sie haben mit voller Absicht auf einen Transporter mit Zivilisten gefeuert und ihn vernichtet. Das alliierte Oberkommando hat seinem Entsetzen und Abscheu Ausdruck gegeben, dass ein alliierter Offizier ein solches Gemetzel an Unschuldigen begeht. 

Als Sie damals Ihr Offizierspatent von der GTVA bekamen, haben Sie einen heiligen Eid geschworen, Ihr Leben für die Bürger der Allianz einzusetzen. Sie haben geschworen, die Beta-Aquilae-Konvention zu achten, die ausdrücklich Angriffe auf Zivilschiffe verbietet. Ihre Handlungsweise verletzt jedes ethische Prinzip, das uns als Zivilisation heilig ist, und Sie werden sich für dieses Verbrechen verantworten müssen. 

Bis zu Ihrer Vernehmung bleiben Sie in Haft. Sollten Sie angeklagt werden, finden Sie sich vor dem Kriegsgericht auf Beta Aquilae wieder."

154, "Zerstören Sie alle sich anbietenden Ziele"

155, "Der hier gehört Ihnen, Alpha 1. Wir geben Deckung, während Sie den Transporter zerstören."

156, "Feindliches Ziel im Anflug. Es ist ein Truppentransporter der Elysium-Klasse."

157, "Auf wessen Seite stehen Sie denn eigentlich, Alpha 1? Wessen Befehle werden Sie befolgen? Entscheiden Sie sich jetzt, Pilot."

158, "Tut mir leid, aber Sie werden Ihre Ordensverleihung nicht mehr erleben, Pilot."

159, "Zerstören Sie diesen Transporter, Alpha 1. Das ist ein Befehl!"

160, "Ihre Zeit ist abgelaufen, Pilot. Wir wissen jetzt alles über Sie. Sie haben uns in Polaris reingelegt, und Sie haben die Sunder zerstört. Jetzt wartet ein Erschiessungskommando auf Sie."

161, "Völlig zwecklos, am Sprungantrieb rumzufummeln, Pilot. Sie haben nicht die nötigen Zugriffscodes."

162, "Sie sind ein kaltblütiger Killer, Alpha 1. Aber wir wissen jetzt alles über Sie. Sie haben uns in Polaris reingelegt, und Sie haben die Sunder zerstört. Hiermit werden Ihnen Ihr Rang und alle Privilegien eines Offiziers der Neo-Terranischen Front aberkannt."

163, "Alpha 1, wir übermitteln Ihnen nun die Zugriffscodes und Sprungkoordinaten in Ihren Navigationscomputer. Ihr Subraumantrieb sollte wieder funktionieren."

164, "Tut mir leid, aber als Geheimagent sind Sie für uns jetzt wertlos geworden. Zurück zum Stützpunkt, wir werden einen neuen Job für Sie finden."

165, "Nicht schiessen! An Bord dieses Transporter sind keine Militärs! Wir evakuieren Zivilisten nach Alpha Centauri. Ein Angriff auf dieses Schiff wäre ein Verstoss gegen die Beta-Aquilae-Konvention."

166, "Alpha 1, hier spricht Command. Wir schicken jetzt Verstärkung. Halten Sie durch, Hilfe ist unterwegs."

167, "Zeigen Sie ihnen, was Sie von der Beta-Aquilae-Konvention halten, Pilot."

168, "Wie der Blitz"

169, "Die 99. Skulls des Sondereinsatzkommandos müssen Snipes und die anderen Überlebenden an Bord der Grall retten."

170, "Sondereinsatzkommando 

Sie wurden für einen verdeckten Einsatz des Sondereinsatzkommandos ausgewählt, in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Nachrichtendienst (GTVN). Unser Hauptziel ist es, der Allianz genaue und umfassende Informationen über die Taktik, Technologie, Aktivitäten und strategischen Ziele aller Kräfte zu liefern, die der GTVA feindlich gesonnen sind."

171, "Lieutenant Commander Snipes 

Um 04.37 fingen unsere Aufklärer eine verschlüsselte Nachricht von Lieutenant Commander Snipes auf. Sein Schiff, die NTT Grall, driftet hilflos in einer von Shivanern überlaufenen Gegend des Nebelgebietes; es kann dort nicht mehr lange überleben. Die Grall war an der NTC Alexandria angedockt, als dieser Kreuzer unsere Blockade am Knossosportal in Gamma Draconis durchbrach."

172, "Notruf

Hier ein Teil seiner Übertragung. Wir haben die Mitteilung bearbeitet, damit sie besser verständlich ist: 

Granitberg, hier Schwarze Taube. Erbitte sofortige Abholung. Maschine und Sprungantrieb ausser Funktion. Position Delta 429 zu 372. Setze Pharosbojen aus, um Suche zu erleichtern. Starke shivanische Verbände und schwere EM-Stürme in der Umgebung. Überleben ziemlich unwahrscheinlich."

173, "Der Rückzug der Allianz

Wie Sie wissen, befinden sich die alliierten Truppen auf dem Rückzug nach Gamma Draconis, daher gibt es so gut wie keine logistische Unterstützung. Wir haben keine Verstärkungen und nur ein einziges Nachschubschiff. Wir operieren hier in einem feindverseuchten Gebiet, also richten Sie sich auf schwere gegnerische Angriffe ein. Diesmal stehen die Chancen schlecht für Sie, Pilot."

174, "Sie wissen, wozu Sie hier sind, also gehen wir gleich an die Arbeit. Unsere Aufklärer haben eine Pharos-Navigationsboje geortet, nicht weit von der Stelle entfernt, an der Snipes' Nachricht empfangen wurde. Ihre Staffel wird an dieser Position mit ihrer Suche nach der Grall beginnen. Nehmen Sie Kontakt mit Snipes auf, wenn möglich. Sein Transporter wurde schwer mitgenommen, und es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass er bereits tot ist."

175, "Dieser Sektor des Nebelgebietes ist extrem aktiv. Die Aufklärer berichten von schweren elektromagnetischen Interferenzen, die Sensoren und Funk gleichermassen lahmlegen. Diese Bojen sind unsere einzige Chance, Snipes und die Grall zu finden. Der EM-Sturm macht es fast unmöglich, ein Raketenziel zu erfassen, wir empfehlen daher eine Zuladung aus Tempests und Rockeyes."

176, "Erst wenn Sie Snipes gefunden haben, rufen Sie Lambda 1. Das ist sehr wichtig. Alarmieren Sie das Rettungsschiff nicht zu früh. Unser Transporter dockt dann an der Grall an und holt die Überlebenden raus. Sie müssen ihnen etwas Zeit zum Umsteigen verschaffen. Gute Jagd!"

177, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Pilot. Sie haben mein Leben gerettet, und dafür schulde ich Ihnen was. Wenn ich bei den Lamettaträgern mehr Einfluss hätte, würde ich Ihnen eine Dienstmedaille verleihen lassen, aber die Dinger verteilt das Oberkommando nicht mal so eben. Sie mussten sich nicht freiwillig melden für diesen Einsatz, aber ich bin verdammt froh, dass Sie es getan haben. Eine wichtige Lektion am Rande: Das Sondereinsatzkommando hat mich nicht wegen meiner treuen blauen Augen gerettet, sondern weil ich wichtige Informationen habe. Informationen sind das einzige, was einen hier draussen am Leben erhält. Ich schlage mich jetzt zum 99. durch, da wartet mein nächster Auftrag. Und ich glaube, wir könnten Sie gut dabei brauchen. Ich habe das schon mit dem Oberkommando abgeklärt, also liegt die Entscheidung bei Ihnen, Pilot. Ich hoffe, Sie tun das Richtige."

178, "Lieutenant Commander Christopher Snipes war einer besten Agenten, die jemals für das Sondereinsatzkommando gearbeitet haben, Sein Mut, sein Einfallsreichtum und seine Entschlossenheit haben uns geholfen, Admiral Bosch und seine Neo-Terranische Front zu besiegen. Snipes arbeitete mehr als sechs Monate im Untergrund und informierte den GTVN in dieser Zeit über die Bewegungen, Strategien und Möglichkeiten des Gegners. Seine Karriere ist für uns ein leuchtendes Beispiel des Dienstes und der Hingabe an die GTVA und die Ideale, für die diese Allianz einsteht. Lieutenant Commander Snipes wird hiermit posthum die SEK-Dienstmedaille verliehen, die höchste Auszeichnung, die das GTVA-Sondereinsatzkommando zu vergeben hat. Ich kenne keinen Offizier, der dieser Ehre würdiger wäre als er."

179, "Beschützen Sie die Grall, während ihre Besatzung auf das Bergungsschiff umsteigt."

180, "Sie hatten keine Erlaubnis, zum Stützpunkt zurückzukehren, Pilot. Ihre Handlungsweise hat nicht nur das Leben all derer gefährdet, die an diesem Einsatz beteiligt waren, sondern auch die Ziele der GTVA in diesem Einsatzgebiet. Eine Desertion ist ein klarer Fall für das Kriegsgericht, und Sie werden vorerst in Ihrem Quartier unter Arrest gestellt, bis die Verhöre beginnen. Bis ein Militärgericht eine anderslautende Entscheidung trifft, werden Ihnen hiermit neben Ihrer Flugerlaubnis auch alle Rechte und Privilegien eines Offiziers der Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Allianz aberkannt."

181, "Verlassen Sie das Einsatzgebiet erst, wenn Snipes und das Rettungsschiff in Sicherheit sind."

188, "Retten Sie Lt. Commander Snipes"

189, "Finden und bergen Sie die Grall"

190, "Unsere Aufklärer hatten nicht ganz unrecht, als sie das hier als 'unsichere Gegend' bezeichnet haben."

191, "Meine Sensoren werden gestört, Sir. Starke elektromagnetische Interferenzen!"

192, "Bitte wiederholen, Alpha 4, ich empfange Sie sehr schwach."

193, "Klappe halten, Piloten. Hört auf mit dem Geplapper. Konzentriert Euch."

194, "Sie haben mich beim ersten Mal offenbar nicht empfangen, Sir. Ich empfehle, dass wir den Navigationbojen folgen."

195, "Folgen wir den Navigationbojen. Wenn die Grall noch existiert, werden uns diese Leitsignale direkt zu ihr führen."

196, "In Ordnung. Snipes hier. Ich hoffe, Sie haben einen Transporter mitgebracht."

197, "Rufen Sie den Transporter herbei, wenn Sie soweit sind, Alpha 1."

198, "Ich sag's noch mal: Rufen Sie den Transporter herbei, wenn Sie soweit sind. Wir müssen so schnell wie möglich mit dem Transfer beginnen."

199, "Überlebende sind an Bord, sir. Lösen Andockklammern."

200, "Evakuierung abgeschlossen. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

201, "An alle Einheiten: Zurück zum Stützpunkt!"

202, "NTT Grall, hier spricht Sondereinsatzkommando. Wir sind hier, um Sie zu bergen. Empfangen Sie uns?"

203, "Sie haben Glück, dass wir Sie gefunden haben, Snipes. Was ist denn hier draussen passiert?"

204, "Die Schivaner haben uns bei Gamma Dracuis überrannt, darum mussten wir einen Notsprung einlegen. Der Rest ist Geschichte."

205, "Wie viele Überlebende?"

206, "17 von uns haben es zum Transporter geschafft. Die Schockwelle hat uns ziemlich übel durchgerüttelt. Kommunikation und Lebenserhaltungssysteme waren alles, was wir hier draussen hatten."

207, "Was ist mit den Nav-Bojen?"

208, "Die Alexandria hat sie abgesetzt. Wir konnten uns nicht auf Navigation oder Sensoren verlassen, daher war das unsere beste Chance."

209, "Haben Sie irgendwelche Informationen für uns?"

210, "Ja, aber das habe ich als geheim eingestuft für jeden, den das nichts angeht. Und solange Sie uns hier nicht rausholen, geht Sie das nichts an."

211, "In die Höhle des Löwen"

212, "Snipen führt die Alpha-Staffel des 99. Geschwaders durch das zweite Knossosportal in den Einsatz."

213, "Die Lage sieht wie folgt aus: Das alliierte Oberkommando hat den vollständigen Rückzug aller GTVA-Einheiten befohlen. Sie haben Gamma Draconis abgeschrieben, deshalb bringen sie die ganze Armada nach Capella, um dieses System zu halten. In der Zwischenzeit sucht das Sondereinsatzkommando eine Einheit, die eine selbstmörderische Mission übernimmt und ein zweites Knossosgerät überprüft, das die Vasudaner tief im Nebelgebiet gefunden haben."

214, "Um uns zumindest eine Chance zu geben, bekommen wir eine Staffel shivanische Jäger, die das Sondereinsatzkommando schon zu Beginn des Nebel-Feldzugs erbeutet hat. Unsere Ingenieure haben diese Schiffe modifiziert und verbessert. Die fliegen sich sogar besser als das shivanische Original, und wenn man es schlau anstellt, wird man vom Gegner nicht mal entdeckt."

215, "Wir gehen mit einer handverlesenen Staffel rein. Sie fliegen Alpha 1. Ich nehme Alpha 2. Zwei unserer besten Piloten, Xinny und Zero, übernehmen Alpha 3 und 4. Unsere Maras verfügen über Subraum-Antrieb, so dass wir den Knoten benutzen können."

216, "Der Zeitplan gibt uns 15 Minuten für diesen Einsatz. Wir springen rein, sammeln Daten, halten uns bedeckt und verschwinden wieder, sobald das Trägerschiff uns das Signal gibt. Unser Subraumantrieb bleibt dann genau 15 Sekunden einsatzbereit. Wenn wir unseren Sprung verpassen, lässt uns das Trägerschiff zurück. Wir können uns also nicht den kleinsten Fehler leisten."

217, "Und noch etwas, das wir nicht vergessen sollten: Wenn wir losfliegen, sind wir die einzigen alliierten Flieger im Nebelgebiet. Es gibt keine Verstärkung, kein Versorgungsschiff, keinen Stützpunkt, zu dem wir fliehen könnten. Darum müssen wir diese Aktion streng nach Plan durchziehen. Wir haben fünfzehn Minuten. Keine mehr, keine weniger."

218, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha 1. Die meisten Piloten fliegen in ihrem Leben nur eine einzige Selbstmordmission. Der Einsatz, den wir überlebt haben, hätte eigentlich unser letzter sein müssen. Die Analytiker der GTVA überprüfen gerade unsere Flugdaten. Leider konnten wir kein einziges dieser shivanischen Geräte vernichten. Die Allianz verlangt von ihren Elitegeschwadern erstklassige Flugleistungen, und unsere Show da draussen war heute etwas enttäuschend. Aber zumindest konnten wir die Allianz warnen. Es war uns eine Ehre und ein Privileg, Pilot. Das alliierte Oberkommando hat Sie wieder der GTD Aquitaine zugeteilt. Man sagt, Sie werden das 70. Geschwader anführen, die Blue Lions, und ich wüsste niemanden, der für diese Aufgabe besser geeignet wäre. Viel Glück."

219, "Es ist möglich, das shivanische Artefakt, das Sie gefunden haben, zu vernichten."

220, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha 1. Die meisten Piloten fliegen in ihrem Leben nur eine einzige Selbstmordmission. Der Einsatz, den wir überlebt haben, hätte eigentlich unser letzter sein müssen. Ich habe den Nachrichtendienst informiert, dass sich jetzt mehrere Schlachtschiffe der Juggernaut-Klasse im Anflug auf das Capella-System befinden. Wir werden alle Hände voll damit zu tun haben, alle Leute hier lebend rauszubringen. 

Gute Arbeit übrigens, wie Sie diese shivanischen Geräte ausgeschaltet haben. Das war eine einzigartige Vorstellung. Die Analytiker nehmen sich jetzt gerade die ganzen Daten vor, aber die Ergebnisse sind mit Sicherheit oberhalb Ihrer Sicherheitseinstufung. Sind sie doch immer. 

Für die Beschaffung genauer und umfassender Informationen über die Taktik, Technologie, Aktivitäten und strategischen Ziele von Kräften, die der GTVA feindlich gesonnen sind, verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit die SEK-Dienstmedaille, die höchste Auszeichnung, die das Sondereinsatzkommando zu vergeben hat. Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Pilot, es war uns eine Ehre und ein Privileg. 

Das alliierte Oberkommando hat Sie wieder der GTD Aquitaine zugeteilt. Man sagt, Sie werden das 70. Geschwader anführen, die Blue Lions, und ich wüsste niemanden, der für diese Aufgabe besser geeignet wäre. Viel Glück."

227, "Abdrehen! Abdrehen! Hauen Sie die Nachbrenner rein!"

228, "Das war ein ganz schön knapp. Wir sollten erstemal 15 Minuten warten und die Unterhosen wechseln. Auf jeden Fall haben wir genug Shivaner entdeckt, und noch ein Sathanas-Schlachtschiff auf dem Weg nach Capella."

229, "Die Sensoren zeigen ein unbekanntes Flugobjekt direkt voraus, shivanische Signatur. Überprüfen Sie das Ding, Alpha 1. Wir geben Ihnen Deckung."

230, "Ich orte zwei weitere unidentifizierte Objekte in unmittelbarer Nähe. Was halten Sie davon, Commander?"

231, "Was denn? Sehe ich vielleicht shivanisch aus? Oh-oh. Schauen Sie sich das mal an. Knossos-Gerät Nummer Drei, 150 Einheiten rechts. Wo zur Hölle sind wir hier?"

232, "Nicht angreifen. Wiederhole: Nicht angreifen. Die überprüfen uns nur. Niemand schiesst, solange die nicht auf uns feuern. Ist wie eine Runde Schwimmen im Haifischbecken."

233, "Alle Einheiten, Feuer erwidern! IFF-Status wurde korrigiert. Die Flitterwochen sind vorbei. Wiederhole: Die Flitterwochen sind vorbei."

234, "Unsere Aufgabe hier lautet, so viele Ziele wie möglich zu erledigen, bevor uns die Zeit ausgeht. Alpha 1, schalten Sie das Gerät aus."

235, "Ausgezeichnet, Alpha 1. Was das auch immer für ein Ding war, jetzt haben die Schivaner eins weniger davon. Schalten wir noch aus, was wir können, bevor wir zum Sprungknoten zurückfliegen."

236, "Okay, das macht dann zwei. Gutes Teamwork, Staffel. Versuchen wir mal einen Drilling. Ausschwärmen und vernichten."

237, "Sauber aufgeräumt. Gute Arbeit, Alpha-Staffel. Ich bin sehr Stolz auf Sie. Und jetzt ab zum Sprungknoten. In Binärsystemen kriege ich immer eine Gänsehaut."

238, "Gegner im Anflug! Kreuzer der Ravana-Klasse, Zielbezeichnung Nebiros. Nachbrenner rein und ausweichen. Wir müssen zu diesem Sprungknoten kommen, Jungs."

239, "Weicht den Strahlgeschützen dieses Kreuzers aus! Wir haben es fast geschafft! Bleibt innerhalb des Sprungknoten! Wer sein Sprungfenster verpasst, ist tot!"

240, "Das wird ja immer besser hier. Da ist noch ein Schlachtschiff von Knossos 3 angekommen."

241, "Die Sensoren orten ein fünftes Schlachtschiff. Wir haben hier ein echtes Problem."

242, "Sathanas Nummer Sechs jetzt im System. Wenn das so weitergeht, stehen hier bald hundert Schlachtschiffe und ballern auf Capella."

243, "Schlachtschiff Nummer Sieben ist angekommen. Wir müssen die Allianz warnen. Tut nichts Unüberlegtes. Bleibt einfach nur am Leben."

244, "Ich orte gerade Sathanas Nummer 8."

245, "Ich habe eine weitere Anzeige auf den Sensoren. Nummer Neun."

246, "Ein kleiner Sicherheitstip, Piloten. Wir haben zehn Minuten bis zum Sprung, also fliegt nicht zu weit raus."

247, "Zeit läuft ab in fünf Minuten. Bereitmachen zum Einsatz."

248, "Zwei Minuten, Zeit läuft! Ausschwärmen am Sprungknoten, Alpha!"

249, "Sprungantrieb wird aktiviert in 1 Minute. Bereithalten zum Sprung."

250, "Alpha 1, ich empfange hier ein paar merkwürdige Daten von diesem Gerät. Sie sollten lieber Abstand halten, falls das Ding explodiert."

251, "Ganz allein"

252, "Die Alpha-Staffel muss die Nosferatu zerstören, eine shivanische Korvette der Moloch-Klasse."

253, "Unsere Aufklärer haben im Gamma-Draconis-System eine shivanische Korvette der Moloch-Klasse geortet, die Nosferatu. Schon früher haben hier alliierte Piloten die Nosferatu angegriffen, und wir haben viele gute Piloten dabei verloren."

254, "Der Geheimdienst glaubt, dass die Korvette unterwegs war zum Capella-Sprungknoten, um die shivanische Flotte dort zu verstärken. Doch das Schiff hat seinen Subraumsprung abgebrochen, bevor es an seinem Ziel ankam; wahrscheinlich ein Versagen des Antriebs oder der Navigation."

255, "Doch jetzt, wo die Korvette von der shivanischen Hauptmacht getrennt ist, haben wir eine einmalige Chance, sie aus dem Verkehr zu ziehen. Ihr Auftrag lautet, die $h Nosferatu und ihre Jägerstaffeln zu vernichten. Das Oberkommando kann nicht mehr als eine Staffel für diesen Einsatz abstellen, und wir haben nur diese eine Chance. Doch in Anbetracht Ihrer beispielhaften Leistungen sind wir sicher, dass Sie dieser Aufgabe gewachsen sind."

256, "Gut gemacht, Staffel Alpha. Obwohl der Feind in der Überzahl war, haben Sie die Nosferatu und ihre Jäger vernichtet, bevor sie an der Front Schaden anrichten konnten. Ihre heutige Tat war unsere Rache für die Soldaten, die beim Kampf gegen dieses Kriegsschiff ihr Leben verloren haben. Das Oberkommando wird mit diesem Ergebnis sehr zufrieden sein."

257, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha. Sie haben die Nosferatu und ihre Jäger vernichtet, bevor sie an der Front Schaden anrichten konnten. Ihre heutige Tat war unsere Rache für die Soldaten, die beim Kampf gegen dieses Kriegsschiff ihr Leben verloren haben. Leider haben einige der Dragon-Jäger den Angriff überstanden. Sie wissen ja, dass der Dragon einer der besten Jäger in der Flotte der Shivaner ist. Daher ist es immer wichtig, sie zu dezimieren. Naja, auf jeden Fall haben Sie Ihr Hauptziel erreicht."

258, "Auch wenn Sie die Jäger der Nosferatu ausgeschaltet haben, so haben Sie Ihr Hauptziel doch nicht erreicht. Daher ist die Nosferatu immer noch eine grosse Bedrohung für unsere Truppen im Gamma-Draconis-System. Ich brauche wohl nicht zu erwähnen, dass das Oberkommando von diesem Ausgang des Einsatzes enttäuscht sein wird."

259, "Sie sollten auf jeden Fall mindestens zwei Bomber mitnehmen, um die Nosferatu zu vernichten."

260, "Das Oberkommando wird nicht erfreut sein, dass Sie weder die Nosferatu noch ihre Jäger vernichten konnten. Sie wurden für diese Aufgabe ausgesucht, weil das alliierte Oberkommando der Meinung war, Sie könnten auch unter starkem Druck gute Leistungen vollbringen. Bedauerlicherweise war unsere Einschätzung Ihrer Fähigkeiten weit überzogen. Daher ist die Nosferatu immer noch eine grosse Bedrohung für unsere Truppen im Gamma-Draconis-System."

267, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Alpha-Staffel. Die Nosferatu ist Geschichte. Kehren Sie zurück zum Stützpunkt."

268, "Die Nosferatu aktiviert ihren Subraumantrieb. Brechen Sie Ihren Einsatz ab. Sichern Sie das Gebiet und kehren Sie zurück zum Stützpunkt."

269, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

270, "Frontlinie"

271, "Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat hat uns seine Strategie mitgeteilt, mit der er die Shivaner im Capella-System festhalten will. Ich werde in einer Stunde zu den Offizieren und Mannschaften der Aquitaine sprechen. Die 70. Blue Lions werden bei der bevorstehenden Operation eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Ich weiss, dass Sie und Ihr Geschwader dieser Herausforderung gewachsen sind."

272, "Willkommen auf der $f GVD $f Zednanreh, Piloten. Unsere Aufgabe hier ist ganz einfach: Wir bewachen den Sprungknoten nach Epsilon Pegasi. Shivanische Kampfverbände versuchen ständig, diesen Knoten in ihre Gewalt zu bekommen und in die Systeme dahinter einzudringen. Das können wir natürlich nicht zulassen. Der $f 32. $f Kampfverband liegt auf der anderen Seite des Knotens im Gefecht gegen die Shivaner. Unsere Patrouille beginnt in 15 Minuten. Das ist im Moment alles, Piloten."

273, "Sie haben es geschafft, die Shivaner aufzuhalten. Das 32. muss Ihnen dafür danken, dass Sie ihm das Leben viel leichter gemacht haben. Gut gemacht."

274, "Die Shivaner sind ins Epsilon-Pegasi-System durchgebrochen. Sie hätten das verhindern können, wenn Sie sich etwas Mühe gegeben hätten. Das 32. hat sich nicht zurückgemeldet, wir gehen davon aus, dass es von den Shivanern völlig aufgerieben wurde. Sie alleine wissen, wieviel besser Sie heute hätten fliegen können, Pilot. Ich hoffe, Sie schlafen gut heute Nacht."

275, "Die Shivaner sind ins Epsilon-Pegasi-System durchgebrochen. Sie hätten das verhindern können, wenn Sie sich etwas Mühe gegeben hätten. Das 32. hat sich nicht zurückgemeldet, wir gehen davon aus, dass es von den Shivanern völlig aufgerieben wurde. Ausserdem haben wir die Zednanreh verloren, und auch das hätten Sie eventuell verhindern können. Sie alleine wissen, wieviel besser Sie heute hätten fliegen können, Pilot. Ich hoffe, Sie schlafen gut heute Nacht."

276, "Halten Sie die Shivaner vom Sprungknoten fern"

277, "Beschützen Sie die Zednanreh"

281, "Die NTF versucht, die GTVA-Blockade eines Sprungknotens zu durchbrechen."

282, "Wir haben gerade eine Mitteilung von Admiral Bosch erhalten. 

Er befiehlt, dass jeder Kampfverband der $f NTF sofort die Hälfte seiner Feuerkraft ins Deneb-System abstellt. Er plant eine Offensive und will seine Kräfte sammeln, bevor er zuschlägt. Unsere Gruppe schickt die drei Kriegsschiffe, die Sie uns bei Ihrem letzten Einsatz in die Hände gespielt haben."

283, "Die Schiffe wurden repariert und unter den Namen $f Retribution, $f Righteous und $f Vindication wieder in Dienst gestellt. Aber ich habe Sie heute rufen lassen, weil es da ein Problem gibt. Die $f GTVA ahnt offensichtlich etwas von Boschs Plänen und will ihn davon abhalten, seine Kräfte zu sammeln."

284, "Ein Kampfverband der GTVA blockiert unsere Route zum Deneb-Sprungknoten. Unsere Aufklärer konnten nur die Anwesenheit eines starken Verbandes bestätigen, wegen des dichten Jagdschutzes aber keine genauen Zahlen feststellen."

285, "Wir müssen reingehen, um unseren Kriegsschiffen einen Weg zum Sprungknoten zu bahnen. Da wir nicht genau wissen, welche Situation wir vorfinden, werde ich die einzelnen Rotten erst nach unserer Ankunft einweisen. Wir müssen unsere Aufgabe erfüllen, egal, was wir da draussen antreffen. Die $f Retribution, die $f Righteous und die $f Vindication müssen die Blockade durchbrechen, alles andere ist Nebensache."

286, "Die Fracht, die wir der $h GTVA abgenommen haben, enthielt einige dringend benötigte Ersatzteile für unsere Jäger der Erinyes-Klasse. Sie werden ein paar davon auf dem Flugdeck sehen, wenn Sie Ihre Schiffe auswählen. 

Seien Sie in 15 Minuten startbereit."

287, "Das war ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten! Es war ein schwieriger Auftrag, aber Sie haben ihn exzellent erfüllt. Dass unsere Kriegsschiffe die Blockade der GTVA durchbrechen konnten, ist ein ungeheurer Moralschub für die ganze NTF und kann Ihrer Karriere nur nützen. Weggetreten in Ihre Quartiere, Piloten. Sie haben sich eine Erholungspause verdient."

288, "Derzeit keine Empfehlungen"

289, "Dieser Einsatz war ein völliger Fehlschlag. Auch wenn es zugegebenermassen schwierig war, hätten Sie sich besser schlagen können. Tausende haben heute ihr Leben verloren, und ein Teil der Schuld daran trifft Sie. Ich werde später entscheiden, ob Sie jemals wieder für uns fliegen werden. Weggetreten!"

290, "Versuchen Sie diesen Einsatz noch einmal. Wenn Sie ihn nicht schaffen können, ist vielleicht die Schwierigkeitsstufe zu hoch eingestellt."

291, "Dieser Einsatz war zumindest teilweise erfolgreich, aber wir hätten mehr erreichen müssen. Wir hätten jedes vasudanische Ziel auslöschen müssen, das sich gezeigt hat. Indem wir aber die Murakami entkommen liessen, haben wir dafür gesorgt, dass sie uns ein anderes Mal das Leben schwermachen wird. Beim nächsten Mal erwarte ich eine saubere Ausführung des Auftrages, ohne solche Patzer. Weggetreten."

302, "Wir beginnen mit dem Zielanflug. Wenn wir ankommen, sollte diese Blockade besser weg sein..."

303, "Hier spricht die GVC Hakiki. Dieser Sprungknoten ist für allen Flugverkehr gesperrt. Drehen Sie ab, oder Sie werden vernichtet."

304, "An alle NTF-Schiffe: Wir werden Sie nicht zum Sprungknoten durchlassen. Ergeben Sie sich!"

305, "Ich würde lieber sterben."

306, "Wie Sie wollen."

307, "Beta-Staffel, schalten Sie die Strahl-Geschütztürme der Murakami aus."

308, "Alpha, greifen Sie jeden Jäger an, der von der Murakami startet."

309, "Righteous und Vindication, schalten Sie die Überlastsicherungen Ihrer Haupt-Geschütztürme ab."

310, "Hier Righteous. Sind Sie sicher? Wir könnten unsere Waffensysteme ruinieren oder eine Reaktorkernüberhitzung verursachen!"

311, "Ich bin mir über die Risiken durchaus im Klaren, Righteous. Wir brauchen alle Feuerkraft, die wir kriegen können, um die Murakami auszuschalten. Feuerbereit machen!"

312, "Waffensysteme der Righteous bereit und vorgewärmt, Sir."

313, "Hier ist die Vindication. Waffe bereit, Murakami als Ziel erfasst. Warte auf Feuerbefehl."

314, "Feuer!"

315, "Uns schmelzen die ganzen Systeme durch! Die Hauptbatterien überhitzen sich."

316, "Schalten Sie Ihre Waffensysteme ab, Righteous."

317, "Geht nicht! Die Steuerung ist zusammengeschmolzen!"

318, "Alle verteilen! Die Righteous geht gleich hoch!"

320, "Rebellenjagd"

322, "In diesem Moment tobt ein Kampf zwischen den $f Alliierten und der $h Neo-Terranischen $h Front um die Kontrolle des Planeten Sirius III. Die alliierten Truppen treffen auf der Oberfläche auf heftigen Widerstand, und unsere Kriegsschiffe sind im Orbit des Planeten in schwere Gefechte mit Rebellenschiffen verwickelt."

323, "Unsere Sensoren haben nun eine Jäger-Staffel der $h NTF geortet, Zielbezeichnung $h Virgo. Sie fliegt vom Regulus-Sprungknoten aus in das System ein. Das Oberkommando vermutet, dass diese Staffel eine Schneise für gegnerische Verstärkungen freiräumen soll. Aufgrund der schweren Kämpfe im Regulus-System erwarten wir allerdings keine grössere Eingreifflotte."

324, "Ihr Auftrag lautet, die Jäger-Staffel der Rebellen zu vernichten und am Regulus-Sprungknoten Patrouille zu fliegen. Fangen Sie eintreffende Feindschiffe sofort ab und zerstören Sie so viele wie möglich, bevor sie nach Sirius III springen können. Leider können wir Ihnen für diesen Einsatz keine weiteren Verstärkungen zur Seite stellen. Viel Glück, Alpha."

325, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Da Sie die Verstärkung der Rebellen am Regulus-Sprungknoten abgefangen haben, konnten unsere Truppen auf Sirius III einen klaren Sieg erringen. Die NTF wurde völlig von dem Planeten vertrieben."

326, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha. Sie haben bis auf eine Handvoll Rebellenschiffe alle Verstärkungen der NTF von Sirius III ferngehalten. Die GTVA hat einen grossen Sieg errungen, bei nur geringen Verlusten. Die letzten kleineren Widerstandsnester der Rebellen werden in diesem Moment niedergekämpft."

327, "Das Oberkommando bedauert, dass Sie nicht mehr Feindschiffe am Regulus-Sprungknoten vernichten konnten. Die alliierten Truppen haben auf Sirius III schwere Verluste erlitten und konnten nur einen knappen Sieg erringen. Die befestigten Stützpunkte der NTF auf Sirius III bleiben solange eine ständige Gefahr, bis wir einen neuen Grossangriff organisieren können."

328, "Die NTF ist nach wie vor auf Sirius III eingegraben. Die alliierten Truppen haben bei ihrem Rückzug schwere Verluste erlitten. Wenn Sie diese Kriegsschiffe der Rebellen am Regulus-Knoten abgefangen hätten, wäre diese ganze Schlacht vielleicht völlig anders ausgegangen."

329, "Sie hatten keine Erlaubnis, sich vom Regulus-Sprungknoten zu entfernen. Als Folge Ihrer Insubordination konnten die Rebellen ihre Truppen am Boden verstärken und unsere Kräfte auf Sirius III dezimieren. Ihre Handlungsweise hat wahrscheinlich Hunderte guter Männer und Frauen das Leben gekostet."

Hier spricht Admiral Petrarch, Kommandant der GTD Aquitaine. Ich möchte zunächst einmal die Geschwader, die hier im Vegasystem neu zu uns gestossen sind, an Bord herzlich willkommen heissen.

Mit ihren 150 Kampf-Raumschiffen dient die Aquitaine als Flaggschiff der 3. Flotte der GTVA, stationiert im Capella-System. Sie gehören ab jetzt zu einer Elite von 10.000 Männern und Frauen, den besten Offizieren und Mannschaften der Allianz."

508, "Die Neo-Terranische Front

Nach 18 Monaten erbitterter Kämpfe ist Admiral Boschs Neo-Terranische Front die schlimmste Bedrohung der regionalen Sicherheit seit dem Ende des Grossen Krieges vor 32 Jahren.

Die NTF verlangt die Unabhängigkeit ihrer Systeme und einen Widerruf der Beta-Aquilae-Konvention, kurz BETAK genannt. Die BETAK etablierte die GTVA als oberste Autorität im terranisch-vasudanischen Raumgebiet."

509, "Die Ideologie von Neo-Terra

Kernpunkt der Ideologie der NTF ist Boschs Vision von Neo-Terra, einer utopischen Gesellschaft, in der die verlorene Grösse und Vorherrschaft der Erde wiederhergestellt ist. Bosch und seine Anhänger lehnen jegliche Allianz mit den Vasudanern als Bedrohung für die Zukunft der menschlichen Rasse ab.
Die Rebellen haben sich in mehreren Systemen festgesetzt, in Polaris, Regulus und Sirius. Aber bevor wir diese Stützpunkte angreifen, müssen wir Epsilon Pegasi, Alpha Centauri und Deneb sichern. Diese umkämpften Systeme sind jetzt die Brennpunkte der alliierten Operationen."

510, "Die Schlacht um Deneb

Das alliierte Oberkommando hat die Aquitaine ins Deneb-System befohlen. Dort werden wir den 13. Vasudanischen Kampfverband verstärken, angeführt von der GVD Psamtik. Sowohl die NTF als auch die GTVA haben in der Schlacht um Deneb schwere Verluste erlitten. In den letzten zweiundsiebzig Stunden haben wir die GVC Andromeda, die GTC Trafalgar und mehr als 15 Jäger-Staffeln verloren. Das Oberkommando geht davon aus, dass die Ankunft der Aquitaine und der Psamtik die Schlacht um Deneb zu unseren Gunsten wenden wird, so dass die NTF gezwungen ist, sich zum Sirius zurückzuziehen."

511, "Hier spricht Captain Loukakis, Geschwaderführer der 53. Hammerheads. Um 03.20 Uhr ist die $f Aquitaine in das Deneb-System eingeflogen. Admiral Petrarch hat seine Jäger- und Bomber-Staffeln zu einem Grossangriff gegen $h NTF-Stellungen im ganzen System starten lassen. Bis jetzt hatte er die Hammerheads noch als Eingreifreserve in Bereitschaft gehalten."

512, "Doch jetzt hat sich eine bedrohliche Situation in der Nähe des bewohnten Planeten Cygnus Prime ergeben. Mehr als 100.000 vasudanische Zivilisten fliehen in Mannschaftstransportern aus den dortigen Kolonien. Alliierte Schiffe nehmen die Vasudaner so schnell wie möglich auf, aber allein durch die logistischen Schwierigkeiten sind die Transporter einem Angriff der Rebellen schutzlos ausgeliefert."

513, "Um 05.45 haben wir einen Notruf von einem Flüchtlingskonvoi aufgefangen, 900 Kilometer vom äusseren Orbit um Cygnus Prime entfernt. Die Vasudaner haben eine Staffel Serapis-Jäger mit der Codebezeichnung Epsilon reingeschickt, die aber gerade Verstärkung angefordert hat. Staffel Alpha, Sie sind diese Verstärkung."

514, "Da diese Transporter keinen Sprungantrieb haben, müssen Sie den Konvoi beschützen, bis ein Hilfsschiff kommt. Da aber alle Kriegsschiffe beschäftigt sind und auch andere Konvois dringend Schutz brauchen, wissen wir nicht, wann ein Schiff verfügbar sein wird. Das Oberkommando wird Sie auf dem Laufenden halten und, falls nötig, Verstärkung schicken."

515, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot. Sie haben den Angriff der Rebellen abgewehrt und beide vasudanischen Transporter vor der Zerstörung bewahrt. Ihre Geschwaderkameraden und ich sind völlig einer Meinung: Sie werden eine Bereicherung für die 53. Hammerheads sein. 

Das Oberkommando meldet, dass 75 Prozent der Flüchtlinge gerettet wurden, mit nur geringen Verlusten. Die restlichen 25 Prozent befinden sich unter alliiertem Schutz und werden in Kürze ausgeflogen. 

Ausserdem haben wir einen grossen Sieg über die NTF davongetragen. Die NTD Jacobus und die NTC Hengst wurden zerstört, und unsere Blockade der Sprungknoten nach Alpha Centauri und Sirius haben die Rebellenflotte von Nachschub und Verstärkung abgeschnitten. Mehr als 600.000 Soldaten unserer Bodentruppen werden bald auf Cygnus Prime landen, um den Planeten für uns zurückzuerobern. 

Bereiten Sie sich auf Ihren nächsten Einsatz vor, Pilot. Die Schlacht um Deneb ist noch nicht vorbei."

516, "Als Offiziere der GTVA haben wir den Eid geleistet, alle Bürger der Allianz zu beschützen. Die Vernichtung des Iota-Transporters ist schlimm, Pilot. Wäre das nicht Ihr erster Kampfeinsatz, würde ich mich für Ihre sofortige Entlassung aus dem Jäger-Korps einsetzen. Aber wir werden Ihnen eine weitere Chance geben. Das Oberkommando meldet schwere Verluste unter den vasudanischen Flüchtlingskonvois. Nur die Hälfte konnte gerettet werden, und selbst diese Überlebenden befinden sich noch in grosser Gefahr. Unsere Bemühungen, die Rebellen aus Deneb zu vertreiben, sind zum Stillstand gekommen. Wir haben zwar die NTC Hengst vernichten können, haben aber die GTC Coriolanus und die GVC Mirage verloren. Versorgungsschiffe brechen pausenlos durch unsere Blockade zur Rebellenflotte durch, und die Befreiung von Cygnus Prime ist ebenfalls ins Stocken geraten. Die Allianz hält an der Niederschlagung dieses Aufstandes fest, auch wenn sie die Schlacht um Deneb nicht ohne grosse Opfer gewinnen kann."

517, "Greifen Sie die Rebellenjäger an, bevor sie die Transporter erreichen. Benutzen Sie Ihre Raketen, um sie schnell auszuschalten, und bleiben Sie dicht beim Konvoi."

518, "Als Offiziere der GTVA haben wir den Eid geleistet, alle Bürger der Allianz zu beschützen. Die Vernichtung der beiden Iota-Transporter ist ungeheuerlich, Pilot. Sie haben den 53. Hammerheads Schande bereitet, und ich werde mich für Ihre sofortige Entlassung aus dem Jäger-Korps einsetzen. Die Offensive der Allianz liegt in Scherben. Nur ein Viertel der vasudanischen Flüchtlinge konnte gerettet werden, Tausende andere wurden von der NTF gnadenlos abgeschlachtet. Das Oberkommando berichtet, dass wir die GTD Aeneas, die GTC Coriolanus und die GVC Mirage verloren haben. Unsere Bemühungen, die Sprungknoten nach Alpha Centauri und Sirius zu blockieren, sind fehlgeschlagen. Der Sicherheitsrat wird die Flotte von Deneb zurückziehen und Verhandlungen mit der NTF aufnehmen."

524, "Durchhalten, Iota! Command wird Ihnen ein Versorgungsschiff schicken. In Ordnung, Alpha, an die Arbeit! Wir müssen diese Transporter verteidigen, bis das Versorgungsschiff ankommt."

525, "Wir haben Ihre Koordinaten an die GVD Psamtik weitergegeben. Das Schiff sollte jeden Moment aus dem Subraum auftauchen."

526, "Geschützleitstand, Energie auf die Photonenstrahlkanonen. Beginnen Plasma-Kerneinleitung."

527, "In Ordnung, Psamtik. Begeben uns jetzt in Position."

528, "Hier spricht Iota 1. Wir haben die Andockklammern gesichert. Flüchtlinge und Besatzung steigen jetzt um."

529, "Iota 1, wir müssen Ihren Transporter aufgeben, um die Andockschleuse frei zu bekommen. Bereiten Sie die Aktivierung des Autopiloten vor."

530, "Iota 1 ist fertig. Keine Besatzung mehr an Bord. Sie können weitermachen."

531, "Hier spricht Iota Zwei. Transfer abgeschlossen. Alle Flüchtlinge und Besatzungsmitglieder sind an Bord der Psamtik."

532, "Schalten Sie bei Iota 2 den Autopiloten ein und lösen Sie die Andockklammern."

534, "Zielobjekt Belisarius wurde ausgeschaltet."

535, "Wir haben Iota 1 verloren!"

536, "Iota 2 ist zerstört worden! Dieses Massaker muss sofort aufhören!"

537, "Command, hier spricht die Psamtik. Alle Überlebenden wurden geborgen. Erwarten weitere Befehle."

538, "Psamtik, wir brauchen mehr Feuerkraft am Alpha-Centauri-Sprungknoten. Übermitteln jetzt die Sprungkoordinaten."

539, "Koordinaten empfangen. Aktivieren Subraumantrieb."

540, "Hier Alpha 2. Habe visuellen Kontakt zum Konvoi, fünfzehnhundert Meter voraus. Der Geleitschutz hat zwei Jäger weniger."

541, "Iota-Transporter, hier spricht die Alpha-Staffel der 53. Hammerheads von der GTD Aquitaine. Wir haben Anweisung, Ihren Konvoi zu beschützen. Wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus?"

542, "Die Sensoren empfangen Gegner im Anflug. Eine Staffel Hercs kommt rein."

543, "Alpha 1 und 2, fangen Sie diese Jäger ab. Wir werden die Transporter verteidigen."

544, "Alle Einheiten: Abstand halten von Psamtik und Belisarius!"

545, "Geschützleitstand, Feuer eröffnen!"

546, "Wir setzen jetzt die Staffeln Zeta und Theta aus. Sie sind von Ihrem Geleitschutzdienst abgelöst, Alpha-Staffel."

547, "Einsatz erfolgreich, Alpha. Zurück zum Stützpunkt. Gut gemacht, Piloten."

548, "Dieser Einsatz ist vorbei, Alpha. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

549, "Iota, Sie haben Freigabe zum Andocken."

550, "Alpha 1, zurück zum Stützpunkt. Sie müssen sich auf Ihren nächsten Einsatz vorbereiten."

552, "Die Rebellen ziehen sich zurück! Sie haben ihren Angriff abgebrochen!"

553, "Die NTCv Belisarius, eine Korvette der Deimos-Klasse, hat unsere Blockade des Sirius-Sprungknotens durchbrochen. Wir verfolgen das Schiff durch den Subraum. Unseren Daten zufolge führt sein Kurs direkt in Ihre Gegend."

554, "Bestätigt, Command. Wir werden das Ziel abfangen."

555, "Sprungsignatur nähert sich! Es ist die Belisarius!"

556, "Command, hier spricht die GVD Psamtik. Wir sind an den vorgegebenen Koordinaten eingetroffen."

557, "Belisarius, hier spricht die GVD Psamtik. Schalten Sie Ihre Energie ab und ergeben Sie sich!"

558, "Negativ, Vasudaner! Die NTF ist die einzige legale Regierung in diesem System!"

559, "Kapitulieren Sie, oder Sie werden vernichtet, Belisarius. Dies ist Ihre letzte Warnung."

560, "Ihr aufgeblasener Hochmut beleidigt uns beide, Vasudaner. Ich werde mein Schiff nicht aufgeben!"

561, "Zeta und Theta, Rückkehr zur Psamtik."

562, "Bestätigt, Psamtik."

563, "Gefechte in der Finsternis"

564, "Das 53. hat Befehl, ein verstecktes NTF-Depot im Deneb-Asteroidengürtel zu vernichten."

565, "Das Oberkommando hat die 53. Hammerheads angewiesen, ein NTF-Depot im Asteroidengürtel von Deneb zu erobern. Rings um das Depot sind sechs Sperrgeschütze postiert, und einige Frachter der Rebellen haben schon damit begonnen, Material aus dem Depot fortzuschaffen. Die NTF hat sich alle Mühe gegeben, dieses Material zu verstecken."

566, "Alpha 1, Ihr Auftrag lautet, alle sich anbietenden Ziele zu vernichten, einschliesslich Frachtern, Ladecontainern oder Sperrgeschützen. Die $f Beta-Staffel überprüft die Ladungen. Unsere Aufklärer haben eine Staffel $h Lokis geortet, die das Depot bewacht; kümmern Sie sich um diese Gegner zuerst."

567, "Unterschätzen Sie nicht die Bedeutung Ihres Einsatzes, Pilot. Für einen Überfall auf ein Depot bekommt man keine Orden, aber er kann trotzdem so wichtig sein wie der Abschuss eines Kreuzers oder einer Korvette. Wir müssen die Rebellen von ihrem Nachschub abschneiden, wenn wir einen deutlichen Sieg erringen wollen."

568, "Das Oberkommando hat keine offizielle Erklärung für die Anwesenheit des Admirals im Deneb-System verlauten lassen. Die getarnte Basis und die abgeschirmten Frachtcontainer tragen nur zu dem Rätselraten um die Pläne des Admirals bei. Unter den gegebenen Umständen gab es nichts, was Sie hätten tun können, um die Flucht von Boschs Befehlsfregatte Iceni zu verhindern."

569, "Der Geheimdienst hat ausserdem in Erfahrung gebracht, dass die Neo-Terranische Front an einem Geheimprojekt namens ETAK arbeitet, wahrscheinlich einer Massenvernichtungswaffe. Indem alle Frachteinheiten in diesem Depot vernichtet wurden, dürften wir Boschs Forschung empfindlich gestört haben."

584, "Alpha 1 und Alpha 3, Sie kümmern sich um die Jäger. Konzentrieren Sie sich auf die Lokis."

585, "Command, wir haben hier ein Problem! Wir können die Fracht nicht scannen!"

586, "Diagnoseprogramm starten, Beta. Haben Ihre Sensoren eine Fehlfunktion?"

587, "Negativ. Diese Frachter haben eine Art Schutzschild. Unsere Sensoren kommen einfach nicht durch!"

588, "Bestätigt, Beta. Abtastung abbrechen und Gegner angreifen!"

589, "Sollen wir die Dinger nicht lieber bergen?"

593, "Moment mal, Alpha. Die Langstreckensensoren orten ein weiteres Ziel drei Kilometer von Ihrer derzeitigen Position."

594, "Ich empfange hier gar nichts, Command."

595, "Wir empfangen eine schwache EM-Signatur von einem der Asteroiden. Wir übermitteln Ihnen die Daten."

596, "Ich empfange immer noch kein klares Signal. Zu viele Störungen."

597, "Auf dem Radarschirm Ihres HUDs sollten Sie einen blinkenden, roten Punkt sehen. Manövrieren Sie Ihren Jäger so, dass der Punkt in der Mitte des Radars bleibt, dann fliegen Sie in die richtige Richtung."

598, "Es ist ein grosser Asteroid, Command, mit irgendeinem Bauwerk drauf."

599, "Schauen wir uns das mal genauer an. Vorsichtig, Leute..."

602, "Command, ich orte Gegner im Anflug."

603, "Vernichtet diese Jäger. Wir müssen eine Schneise für die Delta-Staffel freischiessen."

604, "Hier spricht Admiral Bosch von der Neo-Terranischen Front. An die Krieger der Allianz: Brechen Sie Ihren Angriff sofort ab!"

605, "Command, der Anführer der Rebellen ist in diesem Stützpunkt!"

606, "Ignorieren Sie diese Übertragung, Alpha. Admiral Bosch ist im Polaris-System. Das hier muss ein Ablenkungsmanöver sein."

607, "Pilot, vernichten Sie diese Anlage. Sie haben Ihre Befehle."

608, "Das ist keine Anlage! Schalten Sie den Antrieb dieses Kriegsschiffes aus! Lassen Sie es nicht entkommen!"

Das $f 53. wird eingesetzt, um die $h Iceni zu finden und zu vernichten, bevor sie von Deneb entkommt. Wir haben Ihre Waffenzuladung bereits festgelegt, Ihre Jäger stehen in Bereitschaft. Melden Sie sich sofort auf dem Flugdeck."

620, "Admiral Boschs Befehlsfregatte hat den Sirius-Sprungknoten erreicht. Ich habe für das, was heute da draussen geschehen ist, keinerlei Erklärung bekommen, weder offiziell noch inoffiziell. Ich schätze, wenn wir es erfahren sollen, wird man es uns schon sagen. 

Gute Arbeit, wie Sie diese Jäger und Frachter ausgeschaltet haben. Sie haben den 53. Hammerheads gut gedient. Ihre Leistungen bei diesem letzten Einsatz zeigen, dass Sie das Zeug zu einem Fliegeras haben. Ich habe Ihre Versetzung zu den 107. Ravens vorgeschlagen. Die haben viele gute Offiziere bei Deneb verloren, und sie könnten jemanden mit Ihren Fähigkeiten gut gebrauchen. Das ist eine Eliteeinheit, aber ich weiss, Sie werden uns dort keine Schande machen. 

Viel Glück bei Ihrer neuen Einheit, Pilot. Das Oberkommando hat der Aquitaine die Rückkehr ins Capella-System befohlen. Admiral Petrarch wird um 06.30 zur Mannschaft sprechen."

621, "Sie haben diesen Einsatz erfolgreich abgeschlossen."

Obwohl Sie sich den schwierigen Umständen entsprechend gut geschlagen haben, hätten wir doch unbedingt diesen Frachter erwischen müssen, bevor er das System verliess. Sie werden nicht mehr bei den 53. Hammerheads fliegen. Ich habe Ihre Versetzung zu den 107. Ravens vorgeschlagen. Die haben achtzig Prozent Ihrer Leute bei Deneb verloren und brauchen dringend neue Piloten. 

Das Oberkommando hat der Aquitaine die Rückkehr ins Capella-System befohlen. Admiral Petrarch wird um 06.30 zur Mannschaft sprechen."

623, "Bleiben Sie den Rebellenkreuzern und ihren Strahlgeschützen fern. Die alliierten Grosskampfschiffe werden sich um diese Gegner kümmern."

642, "Unsere Abwehr wird an anderer Stelle im System dringender gebraucht."

645, "Bestätigt, Pilot."

647, "Passen Sie auf, was Sie sagen. Pilot!"

648, "Aufpassen? Wir riskieren hier draussen unser Leben, verdammt noch mal! Da haben wir ja wohl wenigstens eine klare Antwort verdient!"

649, "Das können Sie alles bei der Nachbesprechung diskutieren. Wir haben hier dringende Meldungen, dass Rebellenschiffe auf den Sprungknoten zusteuern. Bereithalten für Auftrags-Update. Command Ende."

650, "Verdammt! Das Oberkommando hat Bosch entkommen lassen!"

651, "Wovon redest Du da?"

652, "Sie haben die Blockade aufgehoben. Dann haben sie uns falsche Koordinaten gegeben. Es gibt keine andere Erklärung."

654, "Was weiss denn ich? Mir sagt man doch nur, was ich unbedingt wissen muss."

655, "Immer mit der Ruhe. Wir sind doch schliesslich auf derselben Seite."

656, "Warum sollten wir die Iceni angreifen? Warum sollten wir diese Fracht zerstören? Ich habe nichts dagegen, nur eine Schachfigur zu sein, solange ich die Spielregeln kenne."

657, "Frachter im Anflug, mit Loki-Geleitschutz. Diese Schiffe sind aus dem Asteroidenstützpunkt entkommen. Vernichten Sie sie, bevor sie den Knoten erreichen."

666, "Nachdem die Shivaner ein alliiertes Kriegsschiff im Capella-System angegriffen haben, erhalten die 107. Ravens den Befehl, ein geheimnisvolles Subraumportal im Gamma-Draconis-System zu sichern."

667, "Der shivanische Angriff

An alle Offiziere und Mannschaften der GTD Aquitaine: Hier spricht Admiral Petrarch. Um Null-Eins-Fünfzehn haben wir eine Übertragung vom Hauptquartier der 3. Flotte empfangen. Ein shivanischer Kreuzer und drei Jäger-Staffeln haben die GTC Vigilant während einer Patrouille am Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten im Capella-System in einen Hinterhalt gelockt und vernichtet.
Command setzte daraufhin die GTD Carthage und die GVCv Dahshor ein. Obwohl diese Schiffe genügen, um die unmittelbare Gefahr abzuwenden, werden alle alliierten Einheiten in erhöhte Alarmbereitschaft versetzt."

668, "Gamma Draconis

Command hat befohlen, dass die Aquitaine die Operation in Gamma Draconis leitet, um Ursprung und Ausmass dieser feindlichen Aktion zu erkunden.

Gamma Draconis ist ein abgelegenes, unbewohntes System, das kurz vor dem Ausbruch des Grossen Krieges entdeckt wurde. Das System hat weder Planeten noch irgendwelche Rohstoffe. Die GTSC Erikson besuchte das System vor 15 Jahren und berichtete nichts Aussergewöhnliches."

669, "Ein Subraum-Portal?

Erkundungsflüge nach Gamma Draconis haben erhöhte Aktivität in der Nähe eines unbekannten Sprungknotens entdeckt. Eine genauere Untersuchung hat ergeben, dass dieser Sprungknoten kein natürliches Phänomen ist, sondern ein gigantisches Subraumportal unbekannten Ursprungs.

Wir wissen nicht, warum die Erikson dieses Portal bei ihrem letzten Besuch nicht entdeckt hat. Es kann sein, dass das Gerät inaktiv war und daher von den Langstrecken-Sensoren nicht erfasst wurde, oder es könnte neu sein."

670, "Die Shivaner

Die shivanischen Schiffe, die die Vigilant zerstört haben, waren keiner Schiffsklasse zuzuordnen, die wir aus dem Grossen Krieg kennen. Die leichten Kreuzer, neue Bezeichnung Rakshasa-Klasse, und die Jäger, Zielbezeichnung Mara, wurden Ihrer Datenbank an Bord hinzugefügt.

Dies ist unser erster Kontakt mit dieser Spezies seit mehr als drei Jahrzehnten. Unsere Einsatzziele sind klar. Wir müssen Gamma Draconis sichern, oder uns droht zum zweiten Mal die Ausrottung."

671, "Hier spricht Leutnant Samsa, Geschwaderführer der 107. Ravens. Also, so sieht die Lage aus: Die $f GTD $f Aquitaine ist um 16.40 Standardzeit in das Gamma-Draconis-System eingeflogen. Das Flaggschiff wird den Capella-Knoten verteidigen, während wir vorrücken, um das System zu sichern. Unsere Aufklärer haben ein shivanisches Nachschubdepot in der Nähe des Subraum-Portals geortet, das ist unser Ziel."

672, "Das Oberkommando glaubt, dass sich die Shivaner auf einen weitaus heftigeren Angriff auf Capella vorbereiten. Die $h SC $h Behemoth, ein Kreuzer der Rakshasa-Klasse, bewacht das Depot mit einer Staffel $h Mara-Jäger. Gegnerische Frachter fliegen immer wieder kurz ins System ein, werfen ihre Fracht ab und fliegen wieder durch das Portal ab. Ihre Aufgabe, Pilot, ist die Säuberung der Gegend von Feindschiffen."

673, "Ihr erstes Ziel sind die Mara-Jäger. Nachdem Sie diese Eskorte ausgeschaltet haben, vernichten Sie die $h Behemoth und alle Frachter in der Gegend. Sie müssen alles unter Kontrolle halten, bis wir die $f Carthage und die $f Dahshor einsetzen können. Nachdem Sie das Einsatzgebiet gesichert haben, werden wir Ihnen die Staffeln $f Delta und $f Epsilon zur Ablösung schicken."

674, "Sie haben Ihren ersten Einsatz gegen die Shivaner überlebt. Auch wenn wir es hier nur mit einem kleinen gegnerischen Verband zu tun hatten, ist Überleben doch der halbe Sieg. Die Kommandanten sowohl der Carthage als auch der Dahshor haben unser Geschwader für den ausgezeichneten Jagdschutz gelobt, den wir ihnen gegeben haben. Der shivanische Kreuzer und seine Jäger hätten diese Schiffe wahrscheinlich zerstört, wenn wir nicht eingegriffen hätten. Gut gemacht, Pilot.
Eine gemeinsame terranisch-vasudanische Forschungsgruppe unter der Leitung von Dr. Mina Hargrove erforscht jetzt das Subraum-Portal. Wir erwarten in wenigen Stunden einen ersten vorläufigen Bericht."

675, "Sie haben Ihren ersten Einsatz gegen die Shivaner überlebt. Auch wenn wir es hier nur mit einem kleinen gegnerischen Verband zu tun hatten, ist Überleben doch der halbe Sieg. Leider hatten die 10.000 Männer und Frauen an Bord der Carthage nicht soviel Glück. Wir als Einheit tragen die Schuld an dieser Katastrophe. Hätten wir besser gekämpft, hätten wir den Zerstörer retten können. 

Eine Totenmesse wird um 01.00 Standardzeit auf Deck 36 abgehalten. Eine gemeinsame terranisch-vasudanische Forschungsgruppe unter der Leitung von Dr. Mina Hargrove erforscht jetzt das Subraum-Portal. Wir erwarten in wenigen Stunden einen ersten vorläufigen Bericht."

676, "Konzentrieren Sie sich auf die shivanischen Bomber"

677, "Sie haben Ihren ersten Einsatz gegen die Shivaner überlebt. Auch wenn wir es hier nur mit einem kleinen gegnerischen Verband zu tun hatten, ist Überleben doch der halbe Sieg. Leider hatten die 6.000 vasudanischen Offiziere und Mannschaften an Bord der Dahshor nicht soviel Glück. Wir als Einheit tragen die Schuld an dieser Katastrophe. Hätten wir besser gekämpft, hätten wir den Kreuzer retten können. 

Eine vasudanisch-orthodoxe Totenmesse wird um 01.00 Standardzeit auf Deck 36 abgehalten. Eine gemeinsame terranisch-vasudanische Forschungsgruppe unter der Leitung von Dr. Mina Hargrove erforscht jetzt das Subraum-Portal. Wir erwarten in wenigen Stunden einen ersten vorläufigen Bericht."

678, "Mehr als 16.000 Terraner und Vasudaner sind in diesem Gefecht ums Leben gekommen. Dass unser Geschwader dieses Massaker nicht verhindern konnte, ist eine unauslöschliche Schande. Unsere Ehre als Offiziere und Piloten der 107. Ravens ist mit dem Blut unserer Kameraden besudelt. Hätten wir besser gekämpft, hätten wir die Carthage und die Dahshor retten können."

Nachdem das Gamma-Draconis-System gesichert ist, untersucht eine gemeinsame Einsatzgruppe aus terranischen und vasudanischen Wissenschaftlern nun das Subraumportal. Bislang können die Forscher aber nur ausschliessen, dass dieses Gerät shivanischen Ursprungs ist.

Dr. Mina Hargrove, die Leiterin der Forschungsgruppe, hat uns einen vorläufigen Bericht über die ersten Ergebnisse geschickt. Hier einige Auszüge daraus."

723, "Dr. Hargrove, Vorläufiger Bericht der Forschungsergebnisse (Auszug)

Das Subraum-Portal ähnelt keiner anderen shivanischen Konstruktion, die wir bislang kennen. Auch wenn die Shivaner als Rasse eine bemerkenswerte Vielfalt an den Tag legen, weist die shivanische Technologie doch stets einige Gemeinsamkeiten auf, einige verbindende Elemente. Keines davon findet sich in dem Subraumgerät, und das bedeutet, dass wir die Erbauer des Portals woanders suchen müssen. Wir wissen nur, dass dieses Gerät sehr, sehr alt ist, und wir reden hier von einer Grössenordnung von mehreren Jahrtausenden."

Das Feld, das durch die Bewegungen der Portalkomponenten erzeugt wird, bildet einen Subraum-Wirbel, der einen Teil des Universums mit einem anderen verbindet. Dr. Hargrove vermutet, dass die Erbauer dieses Geräte benutzt haben, um einen kurz vor dem Kollaps stehenden Sprungknoten zu stabilisieren.

Wenn Dr. Hargrove recht hat, ist dies eine unglaubliche Entdeckung."

725, "Ein Weg nach Hause?

Wenn wir unser eigenes Portal bauen könnten, wäre es möglich, den Sol-Sprungknoten in Delta Serpentis wieder zu öffnen. Seit die Zerstörung der Lucifer den Sprungknoten vor zweiunddreissig Jahren zum Kollaps brachte, ist die Erde von der GTVA abgeschnitten.

Wir könnten vielleicht Subraumknoten stabilisieren, die derzeit zu wechselhaft sind für einen sicheren Transfer, und so Routen zu bislang unerforschten Systemen entdecken."

726, "Hinter dem Portal

Unsere militärischen Operationen konzentrieren sich auf das, was hinter dem Subraumportal liegt. Wir müssen herausfinden, wo dieser Sprungknoten hinführt, und wie gross die shivanische Präsenz dort ist. Vor allem aber müssen wir verhindern, dass die Shivaner nach Gamma Draconis zurückkehren können.
Da das Portal aktiv bleibt, während das Wissenschaftlerteam die Technologie erforscht, sind unsere Systeme so lange stets in Gefahr, angegriffen zu werden. Das alliierte Oberkommando hält das aber in Anbetracht der möglichen Forschungsergebnisse für ein akzeptables Risiko."

727, "Um 15.40 Standardzeit flog die $f GTD $f Aquitaine in das Subraum-Portal bei Gamma Draconis und sprang damit an unsere derzeitige Position. Wir kamen in einem Nebelgebiet heraus, einem riesigen, ionisierten Gasfeld, wahrscheinlich den Überresten einer Supernova. Wir sind weiter in den Raum vorgestossen als jeder andere Terraner in der Geschichte des Subraumfluges."

728, "Der Nebel begrenzt die Reichweite der Langstreckensensoren der Aquitaine. Wir setzen unsere Jäger-Staffeln ein, um die unmittelbare Umgebung zu erkunden und die Stärke der gegnerischen Kräfte festzustellen. Jedes Jäger-Geschwader wird vier Staffeln dafür abstellen."

729, "Alpha, Zeta, Iota und Kappa werden eine Reihe von vier Navigationspunkten abfliegen. Staffel Zeta leitet diesen Einsatz, also folgen Sie Zeta 1 und kommen Sie nicht vom Kurs ab. Bedenken Sie, dass der Nebel Ihre Bordsysteme stören kann. Das ionisierte Feld könnte Ihre Sensoren lahmlegen, sogar schon auf Gefechtsreichweite."

730, "Sie standen einer überlegenen shivanischen Flotte auf feindlichem Gebiet gegenüber. Unter diesen Umständen hätten weder Sie noch irgend jemand sonst etwas tun können, um die Trinity und unser Bergungsteam zu retten. Sie hatten Glück, dass Sie diesen Einsatz überhaupt überlebt haben, Pilot. 

Wir haben nichts mehr von der Kappa-Staffel gehört, seit sie von unseren Sensoren verschwunden ist. Leider müssen wir das Schlimmste annehmen. Wir werden sie als vermisst gelten lassen, solange wir keine Beweise für ihre Vernichtung haben. Unsere Suchstaffeln haben aber keine Spur mehr von diesen Jägern gefunden.

Die Anwesenheit der Trinity vergrössert das Rätselraten um die Pläne der NTF noch mehr. Was hatte die Trinity hier draussen zu suchen, und was weiss Bosch über das Subraum-Portal? 

All unsere Patrouillen haben starke shivanische Kräfte im Nebelgebiet entdeckt. Das Oberkommando wird uns mehr Kriegsschiffe durch das Subraum-Portal schicken, damit wir unsere Erkundungsmission erfolgreich abschliessen können. Die Staffeln Iota und Epsilon haben in der Nähe unserer momentanen Position zwei shivanische Kreuzer entdeckt. Sobald unsere Verstärkung eintrifft, greifen wir sie an."

731, "Verlassen Sie das Schlachtfeld nicht, bevor Sie den Befehl dazu haben."

732, "Beschützen Sie die Discovery"

733, "Beschützen Sie die Trinity"

734, "Folgen Sie Zeta 1"

735, "Patrouillieren Sie im Nebel mit der Zeta-Staffel"

736, "Beschützen Sie die Trinity"

737, "Beschützen Sie die Discovery"

738, "Zeta-Staffel, los."

739, "Kappa-Staffel, Freigabe erteilt."

740, "Iota-Staffel, Sie haben Startfreigabe."

741, "Alpha-Staffel: Start."

742, "Alpha, Formation bilden mit Zeta. Folgen Sie Zeta 1 zu den Nav-Punkten."

743, "Okay, Alpha, erfassen Sie meinen Jäger, und versuchen Sie, dranzubleiben. Benutzen Sie alles, was drin ist, einschliesslich der Nachbrenner, denn wir werden hier schnell durchmüssen."

744, "Gegnerische Ziele bestätigt! Eine Staffel Manticores kommt schnell rein!"

745, "Ich empfange etwas auf meinen Sensoren! Ich kann aber kein Ziel erfassen!"

746, "Mioment... Ich habe optischen Kontakt zu etwas sehr Grossem. Einem Kreuzer oder einer Korvette."

747, "Erkennen Sie die Konfiguration? Ist es ein Rakshasa oder ein Cain?"

748, "Negativ, Command! Es ist ein terranischer Kreuzer! Fenris-Klasse!"

749, "Hier Discovery. Beginne Andockverfahren. Haltet uns solange den Rücken frei, meine kleinen Freunde."

750, "Enterkommando kommt an Bord, Trinity."

751, "Andockklammern gesichert. Okay, Roemig. Wir nehmen Sie und Ihre Crew in Gewahrsam. Machen Sie keinen Ärger, dann passiert auch niemandem etwas."

752, "Wir haben die Trinity verloren! Alle Staffeln zurück zum Stützpunkt! Wir brechen den Einsatz ab!"

753, "Alle Einheiten, melden."

754, "Hier Iota 1, Command. Unsere Sensoren empfangen gar nichts. Wir fliegen völlig blind hier draussen."

755, "Alpha 2 hier. Nichts zu melden."

756, "Zeta-Staffel hier. Wir verziehen uns."

757, "Bestätigt, Command, Iota springt jetzt!"

758, "Ok, gehen wir zurück auf Patrouille. Alpha, folgen Sie mir."

759, "Alpha 1, zurück zum Stützpunkt."

760, "Alpha, Sie haben Ihre Befehle."

761, "Alpha, wir werden den Sammelpunkt gleich verlassen. Springen Sie jetzt, sonst müssen wir Sie zurücklassen!"

762, "Alle Gegner erledigt, Command. Gegend gesichert."

763, "Kappa-Staffel, wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus, Over?"

764, "Kappa-Staffel, hier spricht Command. Bitte antworten Sie."

765, "Iota-Staffel, untersuchen Sie den letzten Nav-Punkt der Kappa-Staffel. Das ionisierte Gasfeld dort stört unsere Verbindung."

766, "Viel Glück, Piloten. Bleiben Sie in dichter Formation und passen Sie aufeinander auf, damit wir alle wieder gesund nach Hause kommen."

767, "Hier Zeta 1. Alles sauber."

768, "Zerstören Sie diese Jäger, und bleiben Sie wachsam. Achten Sie besonders auf Flankenmanöver."

769, "Kein Problem, Command, wir werden sie ausschalten."

770, "Nehmen Sie Ihre Patrouille wieder auf."

771, "Irgendwo in diesem Nebel muss es einen Zerstörer oder einen Stützpunkt geben. Diese Jäger könnten hier draussen nicht alleine überleben."

772, "Dieser Nebel könnte einen Durchmesser von zehn oder zwanzig Lichtjahren haben. Ein einzelnes Schiff da drin zu finden ist unmöglich."

773, "Es sei denn, die Shivaner finden uns zuerst."

774, "Gibt es etwas Neues von der Kappa-Staffel?"

775, "Negativ. Noch keine Meldung von Kappa. Wir klären das bei der Nachbesprechung."

776, "Wie sollen wir denn hier eine optische Bestätigung kriegen? Ich kann in dem Dreck da draussen überhaupt nichts sehen!"

777, "Ich würde lieber gegen die NTF kämpfen. Ich habe mich nicht verpflichtet, um Shivaner zu jagen."

778, "Hör auf zu träumen... Wir sind es, die hier gejagt werden, Pilot."

779, "Command sollte das Portal schliessen und die Aquitaine zum Deneb zurückschicken. Wir haben hier draussen nichts zu suchen."

780, "Wenn das Oberkommando Ihren Rat braucht, wird es Sie zum Admiral befördern und fragen. Jetzt halten Sie die Klappe und konzentrieren Sie sich."

781, "Gegnerische Objekte auf dem Radar!"

782, "Wir orten mindestens eine Staffel Manticores. Wir sollten uns beeilen."

783, "In Ihrem Sektor hat kein alliiertes Schiff etwas zu suchen. Rufen Sie sie, Pilot."

784, "Hier ist die Zeta-Staffel der 107. Ravens von der GTD Aquitaine. Bitte identifizieren Sie sich."

785, "Hier spricht Captain Arthur Roemig von der GTC Trinity. Wir haben schwere Schäden erlitten, und unser Sprungantrieb ist ausgefallen. Wir brauchen sofort Hilfe."

786, "Ihre Zielbezeichnung ist falsch, Roemig. Ihr Schiff ist vor zehn Tagen zur NTF übergelaufen. Man hat Ihnen Ihren Rang und Ihre Bürgerschaft in der GTVA aberkannt. Übergeben Sie uns die Trinity, oder wir vernichten Sie."

787, "Als Kapitän der GTC Trinity kapituliere ich - unter der Bedingung, dass Sie uns auf der Stelle hier rausholen."

788, "Wie ist Ihr Status?"

789, "Wir haben einen shivanischen Angriff abwehren können, aber der Antrieb hat dabei schwer was abbekommen. Ich habe alle nicht-lebenswichtigen Systeme runtergefahren, damit uns die Shivaner nicht orten können. Seither treiben wir herum."

790, "Wie schätzen Sie die Schäden ein?"

791, "Einige Komponenten wurden bei dem Angriff vernichtet, aber mein Chefingenieur meint, eine Feldreparatur wäre möglich."

792, "Wir werden ein Schadenskontrollteam mit den nötigen Komponenten rüberschicken. Schicken Sie uns Ihre Diagnosedaten."

793, "Übertragung beginnt."

794, "Was hatten Sie hier draussen zu suchen, Roemig?"

795, "Als Kriegsgefangener stehe ich unter dem Schutz der Beta-Aquilae-Konvention. Ich werde keine Fragen beantworten, Command."

796, "Ich dachte, die Rebellen erkennen die Konvention nicht an?"

797, "Nein, aber wir, Pilot. Schadenskontrollteam ist unterwegs und sollte jeden Moment ankommen."

798, "Trinity in Bereitschaft."

799, "Mehrere Feinde im Anflug!"

800, "Halten Sie die Shivaner von der Trinity fern, Piloten. Das Schiff übersteht keinen weiteren Angriff mehr. Geben Sie uns eine Zeitschätzung, Discovery."

801, "Wir könnten in 15 Minuten etwas zusammenstricken, Command."

802, "Können Sie die Jäger-Abwehrtürme in Gang bringen?"

803, "Negativ. Wir brauchen alle Energie für die Maschinen."

804, "Wir können sie nicht ewig aufhalten, Trinity! Beeilen Sie sich mit den Reparaturen!"

805, "Sie müssen uns mehr Zeit verschaffen, Piloten!"

806, "Abstand überprüfen, Alpha!"

807, "Alpha 1, Sie fallen zurück. Wir können nicht auf Nachzügler warten."

808, "Bleiben Sie nicht zu weit zurück, Alpha 1, oder Sie könnten mich in dieser Suppe verlieren."

809, "Benutzen Sie Ihre Nachbrenner, damit Sie dranbleiben, Alpha."

810, "Alpha 1, leiten Sie Zusatzenergie auf Ihren Antrieb um, wenn Sie zu langsam sind."

811, "Halten Sie Formation, Alpha 1"

812, "Zeta 1 steht auf Ihrer Geleitschutzliste. Sie können den Jäger mit Ihrer Geleitschutz-Zielkontrolle erfassen."

813, "Erfassen Sie Zeta 1, Pilot. Bleiben Sie dicht beim Anführer."

814, "Zurück in die Formation mit Zeta 1, Alpha. Das ist ein Befehl."

815, "Die Grosse Jagd"

816, "Das 107. unterstützt die GTCv Lysander und die GTCv Actium bei einem Kampfeinsatz im Nebelgebiet"

817, "Nach den jüngsten Siegen an der Bürgerkriegsfront hat der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat den Einsatz zweier Korvetten der Deimos-Klasse im Nebelgebiet verfügt. Die $f Lysander und die $f Actium haben das Subraum-Portal in Gamma Draconis um 23.35 Standardzeit durchflogen und sich dem Kampfverband der $f Aquitaine angeschlossen."

818, "Auf ihrem letzten Flug haben die Staffeln $f Epsilon und $f Iota zwei shivanische Kriegsschiffe entdeckt: die $h Iblis, einen Kreuzer der Rakshasa-Klasse, und die $h Asuras, einen Kreuzer der Lilith-Klasse. Admiral Petrarch hat unseren Korvetten den Befehl gegeben, diese Schiffe zu suchen und zu vernichten. Das 107. wird uns Jagdschutz geben."

819, "Staffel Alpha, Ihr Auftrag lautet, der Lysander und der Actium während dieses Angriffs Geleitschutz zu geben. Ihre wichtigste Aufgabe ist es, alle gegnerischen Jäger und Bomber auszuschalten. Danach erst können Sie den Korvetten bei ihrem Angriff auf die shivasnischen Kriegsschiffe helfen. Sollten wir eine der Korvetten verlieren, werden Sie den Einsatz sofort abbrechen und sich vom Schlachtfeld zurückziehen."

820, "Unsere wichtigste Aufgabe war die Verteidigung der Korvetten, und dabei haben wir als Einheit versagt. Dieses Versagen hat Tausende das Leben gekostet, die Allianz hat eine Korvette verloren. Das hier ist kein Gefechtssimulator, Pilot. Wenn wir Fehler machen, kostet das Menschenleben. Das Oberkommando muss jetzt unsere Ziele in der Nebelregion neu festsetzen. Gleichgültig, ob dieses Debakel nun unsere Schuld war oder aufgrund einer Fehleinschätzung des Oberkommandos unvermeidlich war, unser Geschwader wird auf jeden Fall am Ende als Sündenbock dastehen."

821, "Überwachen Sie den Rumpfzustand Ihrer schutzbefohlenen Schiffe, und vernichten Sie zuerst die shivanischen Bomber. Lassen Sie sich vom Feind nicht von den Korvetten fortlocken."

822, "Das shivanische Kriegsschiff, dem wir begegnet sind, wurde auf den Namen SD Ravana getauft. Die alliierten Truppen stellen sich der Ravana jetzt zum Kampf. 

Nach der Anzahl shivanischer Jäger, denen wir begegnet sind, konnten wir damit rechnen, dass ein gegnerischer Zerstörer irgendwo da draussen im Nebel lauerte. Unsere eingeschränkte Sicht und der verringerte Sensorradius haben es uns schwergemacht, die feindliche Operationsbasis zu finden. Das Oberkommando hatte gehofft, unsere Offensive gegen die beiden shivanischen Kreuzer würde den Zerstörer hinter dem Ofen hervorlocken. Unter diesen Umständen hätten Sie nichts tun können, um die Zerstörung der beiden Korvetten zu verhindern. 

Admiral Petrarch hat mich informiert, dass das 107. eventuell den Schiffen zur Verstärkung zugeteilt wird, die gerade die Ravana angreifen. Machen Sie sich also bereit für den Einsatz, Pilot."

823, "Unsere wichtigste Aufgabe war die Verteidigung der Korvetten, und dabei haben wir als Einheit versagt. Dieses Versagen hat Tausende das Leben gekostet, die Allianz hat die Lysander und die Actium verloren. Das hier ist kein Trainingsmodul, Pilot. Wenn wir Fehler machen, kostet das Menschenleben. Das Oberkommando muss jetzt unsere Ziele in der Nebelregion neu festsetzen. Gleichgültig, ob dieses Debakel nun unsere Schuld war oder aufgrund einer Fehleinschätzung des Oberkommandos unvermeidlich war, unser Geschwader wird auf jeden Fall am Ende als Sündenbock dastehen."

824, "Das shivanische Kriegsschiff, dem wir begegnet sind, wurde auf den Namen SD Ravana getauft. Die alliierten Truppen stellen sich der Ravana jetzt zum Kampf.

825, "Beschützen Sie die Korvetten"

826, "Zurück zur Basis 2"

827, "Zerstören Sie die Asuras"

828, "Zerstören Sie die Iblis"

829, "Beschützen Sie Actium and Lysander"

830, "Wir haben die Asuras zerstört, Command. Ein weiterer shivanischer Kreuzer aus dem Verkehr gezogen."

831, "Einsatz abbrechen, Piloten! Verschwinden Sie da!"

832, "Die Lysander wurde vernichtet! Die Lysander wurde vernichtet!"

833, "Schön langsam auf Kurs bleiben. Diese Kreuzer stecken irgendwo in dieser Gegend. Wir nähern uns jetzt ihrer letzten bekannten Position."

834, "Empfangen Ihre Sensoren irgendwas, Actium?"

835, "Negativ, Lysander."

836, "Wenn wir sie nicht finden, werden sie uns finden. Ich glaube, wir werden nicht enttäuscht."

837, "Die Shivaner haben bisher nur gegen Relikte aus dem Grossen Krieg gekämpft. Wir werden ihnen mal zeigen, was richtige Feuerkraft ist."

838, "Ich empfange etwas! Eine Staffel feindliche Jäger im Anflug!"

839, "Alpha und Beta, fangt diese Kerle ab! Haltet sie von der Lysander und der Actium fern!"

840, "Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse kommt in Sensorenreichweite!"

841, "Bestätigt. Es ist die Asuras! Alle Geschütze feuern!"

842, "Verdammt, Actium, passen Sie auf, auf wen Sie schiessen!"

843, "Weichen Sie dem Strahl aus, dann kann Ihnen nichts passieren, Pilot!"

844, "Alle gegnerischen Jäger ausgeschaltet. Diese Shivaner kämpfen verdammt gut!"

845, "Gut gemacht, Piloten. Helfen Sie den Korvetten, die Asuras abzuschiessen, aber gehen Sie nicht zu dicht ran!"

846, "In Ordnung, suchen wir uns die Rakshasa. Fliegen Sie auf Ihrem derzeitigen Kurs weiter. Wenn Sie neue Munition bunkern müssen, wäre jetzt ein guter Zeitpunkt."

847, "Bei der Technologie, die sie vor 30 Jahren schon hatten, ist es ein Wunder, dass wir den Grossen Krieg überhaupt gewonnen haben."

848, "Keine Schilde. Keine Flakgeschütze. Keine Strahlkanonen."

849, "He, Command. Verraten Sie uns, was die Rebellen hier draussen verloren haben?"

850, "Sie erfahren genau das, was Sie wissen müssen, Pilot. Und jetzt Schluss mit dem Geschwafel, konzentrieren Sie sich auf Ihren Einsatz!"

851, "Wir haben neue Anzeigen auf den Sensoren! Jäger im Anflug!"

852, "Iblis jetzt in Schussweite! Alle Geschütze, Wirkungsfeuer eröffnen."

853, "Bleiben Sie in der Nähe! Wir brauchen noch mehr Jagdschutz! Lassen Sie sich nicht fortlocken!"

854, "Eine Staffel von Seraphims nähert sich mit hoher Geschwindigkeit! Fangen Sie die Bomber ab!"

855, "Rumpfzustand der Iblis im roten Bereich! Wir sind fast da!"

856, "Command, irgend etwas Grosses ist hier gerade reingesprungen. Es ist aber keine Konfiguration, die unsere Datenbank erkennt!"

857, "Wo? Was denn? Ich bekomme keine optische Anzeige!"

858, "Command, wir haben hier ein mögliches Problem!"

859, "Können Sie sich das näher ansehen, Lysander?"

860, "Wir haben die Actium verloren!"

861, "Alle Schiffe zurück zum Stützpunkt! Wir müssen uns neu formieren. Los, raus da, Piloten!"

862, "Die Seraphims sind erledigt! Gut gemacht, Piloten!"

863, "Haben Sie das von der Kappa-Staffel gehört? Spurlos verschwunden, gerade mal fünf Kilometer von der Aquitaine entfernt."

864, "Ihre Patrouille hat die NTC Trinity gefunden, stimmt's?"

865, "Ja, das war das Schiff von Arthur Roemig. Kaum zu glauben, dass er zum Verräter geworden ist."

866, "Der Untergang der Ravana"

867, "Das 107. leitet einen Bomberangriff gegen den shivanischen Zerstörer Ravana."

868, "Hier spricht Leutnant Samsa. Der alliierte Angriff auf die $h SD $h Ravana läuft nicht gut. Wir haben die $f GTD $f Delacroix verloren, und fast alle übrigen Kriegsschiffe im Kampfverband sind angeschlagen. Petrarch setzt das 107. zur Verstärkung ein. Das Oberkommando schickt ausserdem die $f GVC $f Somtus und die $f GTC $f Yakiba her. Sobald sie durch das Subraum-Portal kommen, weisen wir sie in ihre Feuerpositionen ein."

869, "Bei diesem Einsatz werden wir den GTB Boanerges fliegen, den neuen Kampfbomber der Allianz. Der Boanerges hat ein Maximum an Schilden und Nutzlast, ist dabei aber noch beweglich genug, dass man ihn als taktische Einheit einsetzen kann. Der Bomber fliegt sich nicht so gut wie der Herc II, also bleiben Sie immer in Bewegung. Bomber sind ein leichtes Ziel."

870, "Mit unseren Cyclops-Torpedos haben wir die nötige Feuerkraft, um die $h Ravana zu zerstören. Wenn Sie beim Feuern zu weit vom Ziel entfernt sind, schiesst die Flak Ihre Torpedos ab, also gehen Sie so dicht ran wie möglich. Sobald Sie Ihre Salve abgefeuert haben, schieben Sie die Nachbrenner rein, um von der Explosion wegzukommen. Der Cyclops hat eine ausgesprochen lange Aufschaltzeit bei der Zielerfassung."

871, "Wenn wir Erfolg haben, ist der Subraumknoten gesichert, der den Nebel mit Gamma Draconis verbindet. Wenn wir versagen, bereiten wir den Weg für eine shivanische Invasion unserer Heimatwelten. Viel Glück, Pilot. Wir wissen, dass Sie es schaffen können."

872, "Die Zerstörung der Ravana ist der grösste Sieg über die Shivaner seit dem Ende des Grossen Krieges. Wir haben den Subraumknoten gesichert, der den Nebel mit Gamma Draconis verbindet, und wir haben unserem Angstgegner unsere neue technologische Überlegenheit demonstriert. Wir haben jedem Zweifler bewiesen, dass wir die Feuerkraft haben, um mit der shivanischen Bedrohung fertig zu werden. 

Eine neue Klasse von Abfangjägern wird an Bord der Aquitaine stationiert. Ich habe Sie für eine Versetzung in diese Einheit empfohlen. Abfangjäger sind schnelle Hochleistungsmaschinen, die von ihren Piloten ausgezeichnete Reflexe verlangen. Sie haben das nötige Talent dafür, und Sie werden den Ravens keine Schande machen. 

Das Oberkommando hat die Aquitaine ins Capella-System zurückbeordert, und dort werden wir von Admiral Petrarch unsere neuen Einsatzorte erfahren."

873, "Nach diesem Debakel steht uns nun ein gewaltiger Krieg an mehreren Fronten bevor. Jemand muss dafür den Kopf hinhalten, und zwar das 107. Geschwader. Das Oberkommando hat unsere Einheit aufgelöst und wird den Überlebenden neue Posten in der alliierten Flotte zuweisen. Offen gesagt würde es mich wundern, wenn sie uns noch was Wichtigeres als Versorgungsschiffe fliegen lassen. Weggetreten."

874, "Überwachen Sie den Rumpfzustand Ihrer verbündeten Schiffe. Das hilft, die Ravana schon früh während dieses Einsatzes zu entwaffnen."

875, "Wir haben die Ravana zerstört und den Subraumknoten gesichert, der den Nebel mit Gamma Draconis verbindet. Doch in Anbetracht unserer Verluste ist die bestenfalls ein Pyrrhussieg. Die Delacroix, die Champion, die Khenmu, die Heisenberg, die Yakiba und die Somtus sind alle in dieser Schlacht vernichtet worden. 

Aufgrund der gewaltigen Ausfälle hat Admiral Petrarch die Jägergeschwader der Aquitaine neu organisiert. Als Kommandeur der 107. Ravens ist es meine traurige Pflicht, Sie zu informieren, dass unsere Einheit nach einer erfolgreichen, vierzigjährigen Geschwadergeschichte aufgelöst wird. 

Das Oberkommando hat die Aquitaine ins Capella-System zurückbeordert, und dort werden wir unsere neuen Einsatzorte erfahren."

876, "Zerstören Sie die Ravana"

877, "Alle alliierten Kriegsschiffe wurden vernichtet. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

878, "Ich habe die Ravana im Sensor erfasst. Der Zerstörer ist momentan ausser Reichweite."

879, "Keine Sicht auf alliierte Schiffe, aber wir sehen ihre Geschützsignatur."

880, "Bomber, Zielanflug auf die Ravana. Wir müssen das jetzt beenden."

881, "Bestätigt, Command. Bomben scharf und bereit."

882, "Achten Sie auf das Feuer unserer Schiffe! Ein Treffer, und Sie schaffen es nicht mehr bis zum Versorgungsschiff."

883, "Command, hier spricht die GTC Yakiba. Wir greifen jetzt die Ravana an."

884, "Command, hier spricht die GVC Somtus. Setzen unsere Geschütztürme ein. Wirkungsfeuer eröffnet."

885, "Wir brauchen mehr Feuerkraft, Command!"

886, "Derzeit können uns keine alliierten Schiffe helfen. Wir müssen unsere Ziele mit den Mitteln erreichen, die uns für diesen Einsatz zur Verfügung stehen."

887, "Der Rumpf der Ravana weist kritische Schäden auf. Zerstörung des Primärziels steht unmittelbar bevor."

888, "Zielobjekt Ravana ausgeschaltet! An alle Einheiten: Zurück zum Stützpunkt!"

889, "Wir haben die Heisenberg verloren!"

890, "Die Shivaner haben die Yakiba zerstört!"

891, "Die Khenmu ist verloren!"

892, "Die Somtus ist zerstört worden!"

893, "Das Sechste Wunder"

894, "Die 242. Suicide Kings schlagen einen Rebellenangriff auf die Station Enif zurück, die Operationsleitstelle der GTVA im Epsilon-Pegasi-System."

895, "Das Enif-Massaker

Vor 36 Stunden begann die NTF eine Grossoffensive im Epsilon-Pegasi-System und überraschte die dort stationierte 6. Flotte der GTVA völlig. Konteradmiral Koth führt diesen Vorstoss der Rebellen von der NTD Repulse aus. Er hat 75 Prozent unserer Truppen in diesem System ausgeschaltet. Die Verluste liegen damit bei über 80.000.

Wir müssen schnell handeln, sonst ist ein deutlicher Sieg für die Rebellen unausweichlich."

896, "Patt im Sirius

Die GTD Aquitaine führt den alliierten Gegenschlag gegen Koth und seine Kriegsschiffe. Wir werden im Capella-System neue Vorräte fassen, bevor wir an die Front fliegen. Ausserdem haben wir erfahren, dass unser Sirius-Feldzug fehlgeschlagen ist. Die Zangenbewegung von Alpha Centauri und Deneb aus stiess auf heftigen Widerstand. Falls uns keine militärische Lösung einfällt, wie wir die Rebellen schlagen können, wird die GTVA gezwungen sein, die Autorität der NTF in den Systemen Sirius, Regulus und Polaris anzuerkennen."

897, "Verstärkte Anstrengungen

Alliierte Ingenieure entwickeln und adaptieren derzeit Technologien, die es uns ermöglichen sollen, in dem Nebel effektiver zu kämpfen. Dr. Hargrove und ihr Forschungsteam untersuchen weiterhin das Subraumportal. Ihre Ergebnisse unterliegen der Geheimhaltungsstufe Phi.

Bis sich die Situation in Epsilon Pegasi normalisiert hat, stellt die GTVA all ihre Operationen im Nebelgebiet ein."

898, "Hier spricht Lieutenant Commander Cordova, Geschwaderführer der 242. Suicide Kings. Willkommen bei Epsilon Pegasi, Piloten. Die $f Station $f Enif, der Hauptstützpunkt der Allianz in diesem System, wird angegriffen. Obwohl wir die $h NTC $h Outrage zerstört haben, bombardiert die $h Cato weiterhin die Station mit schwerem Strahlgeschützfeuer."

899, "Die Evakuierung des zivilen Personals der $f Station $f Enif ist bereits im Gange. Wie Sie wissen, stehen Zivilisten unter dem Schutz der Beta-Aquilae-Konvention, aber die $h NTF lehnt diesen Vertrag und seine Schutzbestimmungen ab. Zum Glück ist der grösste Teil des Zivilistenkonvois bereits sicher zum Capella-Sprungknoten gelangt."

900, "Ihr Auftrag lautet, die $f Station $f Enif zu verteidigen. Als Führer der Staffel Alpha werden Sie mit Ihren Kameraden die Jäger und Kriegsschiffe vernichten, die unsere Anlage angreifen. Wenn die Rebellen ihre Zeus-Bomber einsetzen, fangen Sie die Raketen ab, bevor sie auf der Basis einschlagen."

901, "Die alliierten Truppen greifen die Rebellen im gesamten System an. Sobald wir eine Einheit abziehen können, werden wir sie Ihnen zur Verstärkung schicken. Bis wir diese Verstärkungen bereitstellen können, sind Sie aber auf sich alleine gestellt. Dieser Einsatz ist der erste Gefechtstest für den Perseus- Abfangjäger, also sollten wir eine gute Show hinlegen!"

902, "Als man Sie für die 242. Suicide Kings ausgewählt hat, erschienen Sie als ein vielversprechender Kandidat für einen leitenden Posten. Die Offiziere, die Sie uns empfohlen haben, hatten Vertrauen in Ihre Führungsqualitäten. Diese Einschätzung war, wie sich jetzt herausgestellt hat, etwas voreilig, gelinde gesagt. 

Ich bin sehr enttäuscht von Ihnen, Pilot. Auch wenn Sie wahrscheinlich als einzelner Pilot sehr gut gekämpft haben, so waren Sie doch nicht in der Lage, Ihre Teamkameraden optimal einzusetzen. Wir haben die Station Enif verloren, weil Sie vor eine Situation gestellt wurden, für die Sie nicht gerüstet waren. Das ist nicht Ihre Schuld, aber wenn Sie in einer Eliteeinheit fliegen wollen, müssen Sie den Unterschied lernen zwischen einem passabel erledigten Auftrag und einer Leistung, die weit über normale Pflichterfüllung hinausgeht."

903, "Zerstören Sie die Geschütztürme gegnerischer Kriegsschiffe und fangen Sie feindliche Bomber ab. Befehlen Sie Ihren Kameraden, Ziele anzugreifen oder zu beschützen, um die Sie sich nicht kümmern können."

904, "Bei Ihrer mutigen Verteidigung der Station Enif waren Sie Augenzeuge eines historischen Moments: des ersten Kampfeinsatzes der GTVA Colossus. 

Sie und Ihre Staffel haben uns auch gezeigt, was der Abfangjäger Perseus wirklich kann. Gegen eine überwältigende Übermacht haben Sie einen Angriff auf eine Station zurückgeschlagen, die für die Allianz von ausschlaggebender strategischer Bedeutung ist. 

Der Kommandant der Station Enif lässt Ihnen seinen persönlichen Dank übermitteln, Pilot. Ich bin sicher, Sie werden gut zu den Suicide Kings passen. 

Die Allianz hat überall im System eine Schlacht nach der anderen gewonnen und dabei die NTC Rapier, die NTC Explorer und die NTD Normandy vernichtet. Diese Siege haben den Vormarsch der Rebellen gestoppt, und mit Hilfe der Colossus werden wir sie ins Polaris-System zurückdrängen, womit Epsilon Pegasi ein für allemal gesichert wäre."

905, "Für ausgezeichnete kämpferische Fähigkeiten im Gefecht verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit das Fliegerkreuz Erster Klasse."

906, "Beschützen Sie die Transporter"

907, "Zerstören Sie die Cato"

908, "Zerstören Sie die Conquest"

909, "Zerstören Sie die Hawkwood"

910, "Beschützen Sie die Station Enif"

911, "Station Enif hier. NTF-Bomber nähern sich!"

912, "Noch mehr Rebellenbomber im Anflug! Abfangen und vernichten!"

913, "Alle zivilen Transporter sind sicher weggekommen."

914, "Zurück zum Stützpunkt, Piloten. Einsatz erfolgreich."

915, "Wir haben Station Enif verloren! Wiederhole:Station Enif wurde vernichtet!"

916, "Hier spricht die GTFr Calypso. Wir sind von der Station Enif gestartet. Aktivieren jetzt Subraumantrieb."

917, "NTF-Jäger, Sie schiessen auf ein Zivilschiff! Brechen Sie Ihren Angriff ab!"

918, "Alpha, wir brauchen etwas Jagdschutz auf der Calypso! Halten Sie die Rebellen zurück, damit die Zivilisten fliehen können!"

919, "Die Calypso ist zerstört worden!"

920, "Hier spricht die Mannheim. Wir haben Kurs auf den Capella-Sprungknoten gesetzt. Aktivieren jetzt den Sprungantrieb."

921, "Unser Transporter befördert zivile Passagiere! Ihr Angriff ist eine Verletzung der Beta-Aquilae-Konvention!"

922, "Piloten, beschützen Sie die Mannheim! Der Transporter wird angegriffen!"

923, "Wir haben die Mannheim verloren! An Bord dieses Transporters waren zweihundert Zivilisten!"

924, "Fangen Sie diese Bomben ab, bevor sie die Gebäude treffen! Wir dürfen diese Basis nicht verlieren!"

925, "Command, hier ist die Station Enif! Eine neue Staffel Bomber ist hereingekommen! Erbitten sofortigen Jagdschutz!"

926, "Hier ist die Station Enif. Wir haben nur mässige Schäden abbekommen. Alle getroffenen Bereiche wurden abgeschottet. Die Reparaturmannschaften melden, dass sie die Situation unter Kontrolle haben."

927, "Station Enif hier, Command. Schwere Verluste auf allen Decks, und die Aussenhülle gibt langsam nach. Allgemeine Evakuierung im Gang. Setzen Fluchtkapseln aus."

928, "Hier ist die Station Enif! Alle Systeme im roten Bereich!"

929, "Gut gemacht. Die NTC Cato ist zerstört worden!"

930, "Wir haben die Hawkwood besiegt!"

931, "Die Conquest ist vernichtet!"

932, "Unsere Flotte hat die Decatur vernichtet!"

933, "Hier ist die Station Enif. Danke für Ihre Hilfe, Piloten. Sie haben eine beachtliche Leistung gezeigt."

934, "Alle Allianzschiffe zurück zum Stützpunkt. Diese Operation war ein völliger Reinfall."

935, "Empfange eine Sprungsignatur, unbekannte Konfiguration!"

936, "Command! Da kommt gerade ein gewaltiges Kriegsschiff aus dem Subraum!"

937, "Überprüfe IFF-Status, Command!"

938, "IFF identifiziert Status als verbündet. Darf ich vorstellen: die Colossus, das grösste Weltraum-Kriegsschiff, das je gebaut wurde."

939, "Hier spricht die GTVA Colossus. Jäger, halten Sie Abstand zu den gegnerischen Kriegsschiffen. Alle Geschützbatterien, Feuer frei."

940, "Colossus, halten Sie Ihre momentane Position. Sie werden die Station Enif verteidigen, bis Ablösung kommt."

941, "In den Maelstrom"

942, "Das 242. soll einem Konvoi, der unterwegs ist zur GTVA Colossus, Geleitschutz durch ein Asteroidenfeld geben, in dem Rebellen vermutet werden."

943, "Das 242. soll einem Konvoi Geleitschutz geben, der unterwegs ist zur $f GTD $f Colossus. Wir bereiten die $f Colossus auf einen alliierten Gegenangriff vor und kämpfen mit den logistischen Problemen, die bei der Versorgung eines so gewaltigen Kriegsschiffes auftreten. Grosse Konvois aus Transportern, Gasminern und Frachtern sind zu diesem Zweck zusammengestellt worden."

944, "Die $f Colossus kommt am Capella-Sprungknoten herein und trifft sich dort mit den Konvois, auf der anderen Seite eines Asteroidenfeldes. In dieser Gegend gibt es allerdings eine Menge Rebellenschiffe. Der Geheimdienst vermutet, dass die Rebellen eher die Nachschubkonvois angreifen werden, statt sich mit der $f Colossus direkt anzulegen."

945, "Sie führen die Staffel Alpha, den wichtigsten Teil des Geleitschutzes. Ihr Auftrag lautet, die $f GTFr $f Parracombe, die $f GTG $f Avila und die $f GVG $f Jooyun zu beschützen. Die $f Avila und die $f Jooyun sind Minenschiffe, die speziell dafür entworfen wurden, Gasriesen anzuzapfen, um daraus Treibstoff für die Reaktoren der $f Colossus zu gewinnen."

946, "Die Vasudaner haben eine Staffel Serapis-Jäger abgestellt, um die $f Jooyun zu beschützen. Sie haben keine Befehlsgewalt über diese Einheit. Trotzdem sind die 242. Suicide Kings verantwortlich für die Sicherheit der $f Jooyun. Achtzehn Monate Bürgerkrieg belasten langsam auch die terranisch-vasudanischen Beziehungen, besonders in umstrittenen Systemen. Also sorgen Sie dafür, dass die Jooyun heil durchkommt."

947, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Der Konvoi hat es bis zum Treffpunkt geschafft, ohne auch nur ein einziges Schiff zu verlieren. Während nun die anderen Frachter und Gasminer ihre Ladung bei der Colossus abliefern, trifft die Allianz ihre letzten Vorbereitungen für unseren Angriff auf Admiral Koth und die NTD Repulse. Nach einer Demonstration unserer ultimativen Waffe dürften sich die Rebellenführer ihre territorialen Ansprüche wohl noch einmal gut überlegen. Überall im System melden GTVA-Einheiten erfolgreiche, gut koordinierte Schläge gegen NTF-Ziele. Das Oberkommando ist zuversichtlich, dass die langandauernde Patt-Situation in Epsilon Pegasi sich bald zu unseren Gunsten auflösen wird."

948, "Admiral Petrarch und das 242. haben sich bei den Vasudaner für den Verlust der Jooyun formell entschuldigt. Seien Sie lieber dankbar, dass wir nicht mehr in einer Ära leben, in der ein solcher Zwischenfall einen vernichtenden Krieg zwischen unseren Rassen auslösen kann. Die GTVA ist stark, und wir haben die Missverständnisse der Vergangenheit überwunden. Doch die Vernichtung eines verbündeten Schiffes, das unter unserem Schutz stand, ist beschämend für unser Geschwader. Dass so etwas unter Ihrem Kommando geschehen konnte, sollte Ihnen ernsthaft zu denken geben. Fragen Sie sich selbst, was Sie hätten tun können, um diese Schlappe zu verhindern, und was Sie tun werden, um sicherzustellen, dass so etwas in Zukunft nie wieder vorkommt. Unsere Offensive gegen die NTF hat nur begrenzten Erfolg. Allein die Colossus hat genug Feuerkraft, um dieses Patt aufzubrechen. Wenn wir versagen, hat die Allianz keine andere Wahl, als auf Boschs Forderungen einzugehen."

949, "Behalten Sie Ihre Schutzbefohlenen mit Hilfe der Taste 'E' immer im Auge, und lassen Sie sich auch nicht von den Jägern ablenken. Um Bomber müssen Sie sich immer zuerst kümmern. Um Geschütztürme auszuschalten, ist die Harpoon am besten geeignet. Die Hornet ist am wirksamsten gegen Jäger. Achten Sie darauf, dass die Rakete ungehinderte Sicht auf das Ziel hat."

950, "Obwohl unser Einsatz generell ein Erfolg war, haben wir doch die Parracombe verloren. Der Verlust eines einzelnen Frachters wird den Einsatz der Colossus nicht verzögern, aber unser Geschwader muss die Verantwortung dafür tragen, dass ein Schiff, das wir beschützen sollten, vernichtet wurde. Sie sind jetzt in einer Führungsposition, Pilot. Fragen Sie sich selbst, was Sie hätten tun können, um diese Schlappe zu verhindern, und was Sie tun werden, um sicherzustellen, dass so etwas in Zukunft nie wieder vorkommt. 

Unsere Offensive gegen die NTF hat nur begrenzten Erfolg. Allein die Colossus hat genug Feuerkraft, um dieses Patt aufzubrechen. Wenn wir versagen, hat die Allianz keine andere Wahl, als auf Boschs Forderungen einzugehen."

951, "Obwohl unser Einsatz generell ein Erfolg war, haben wir doch die Avila verloren. Der Verlust eines einzelnen Gasminers wird den Einsatz der Colossus nicht verzögern, aber unser Geschwader muss die Verantwortung dafür tragen, dass ein Schiff, das wir beschützen sollten, vernichtet wurde. Sie sind jetzt in einer Führungsposition, Pilot.

Unsere Offensive gegen die NTF hat nur begrenzten Erfolg. Allein die Colossus hat genug Feuerkraft, um dieses Patt aufzubrechen. Wenn wir versagen, hat die Allianz keine andere Wahl, als auf Boschs Forderungen einzugehen."

952, "Die NTF hat unsere Nachschubkonvois förmlich zerfetzt und damit das Oberkommando gezwungen, die Colossus zurückzuziehen und unseren Angriff auf Admiral Koth und die Repulse aufzuschieben. Ihr Konvoi hat alle drei Schiffe verloren; eine schreckliche Niederlage, egal, wie man es betrachtet. 

Die Nachrichten aus der Hauptstadt auf Beta Aquilae sind auch nicht gut. Immer mehr Stimmen befürworten eine Verhandlungslösung und eine separate NTF-Kolonie, sogar im Sicherheitsrat, und das, obwohl die Colossus jetzt einsatzbereit ist. Die Gegner des Colossus-Programms bezeichnen das Schiff als eine Monstrosität, die an logistischen Problemen zugrunde gehen wird. Für Admiral Petrarch und die Aquitaine hätte es kaum schlimmer ausgehen können."

953, "Behalten Sie Ihre Schutzbefohlenen mit Hilfe der Taste 'E' immer im Auge, und lassen Sie sich auch nicht von den Jägern ablenken. Um Bomber müssen Sie sich immer zuerst kümmern, dann um Jäger, schliesslich um Geschütztürme. Sobald die Maelstrom erscheint, haben Sie nur wenig Zeit, bevor sie in Schussweite auf den Konvoi ist. Benutzen Sie die Taste 'K', um Geschütztürme anzuvisieren. Um Geschütztürme auszuschalten, ist die Harpoon am besten geeignet. Die Hornet ist am wirksamsten gegen Jäger. Achten Sie darauf, dass die Rakete ungehinderte Sicht auf das Ziel hat."

954, "Die NTF hat unsere Nachschubkonvois förmlich zerfetzt, nur eine Handvoll Frachter und Gasminer hat den gut koordinierten Angriff überlebt. Ihr Konvoi hat zwei von drei Schiffen verloren; eine Niederlage, egal, wie man es betrachtet. 

Die Nachrichten aus der Hauptstadt auf Beta Aquilae sind auch nicht gut. Immer mehr Stimmen befürworten eine Verhandlungslösung und eine separate NTF-Kolonie, sogar im Sicherheitsrat, und das, obwohl die Colossus jetzt einsatzbereit ist. Die Gegner des Colossus-Programms bezeichnen das Schiff als eine Monstrosität, die an logistischen Problemen zugrunde gehen wird. Für Admiral Petrarch und die Aquitaine hätte es kaum schlimmer ausgehen können."

955, "Dass die Jooyun überlebt hat, ist vielleicht eine gute Nachricht für unsere vasudanischen Verbündeten, aber der Verlust der Parracombe und der Avila ist eine mittlere Katastrophe für uns. 

Die Nachrichten aus der Hauptstadt auf Beta Aquilae sind auch nicht gut. Immer mehr Stimmen befürworten eine Verhandlungslösung und eine separate NTF-Kolonie, sogar im Sicherheitsrat, und das, obwohl die Colossus jetzt einsatzbereit ist. Die Gegner des Colossus-Programms bezeichnen das Schiff als eine Monstrosität, die an logistischen Problemen zugrunde gehen wird. Für Admiral Petrarch und die Aquitaine hätte es kaum schlimmer ausgehen können."

956, "Indem Sie die Sperrgeschütze der Rebellen in dem Asteroidenfeld beseitigt haben, konnten Sie die Gefahr für zukünftige Konvois auf dieser Route erheblich verringern. Ihre Initiative hat wahrscheinlich vielen Menschen das Leben gerettet."

957, "Sie haben zwar die Maelstrom vernichtet, aber zuvor nicht ihren vorderen Geschützturm ausgeschaltet. Hätten Sie sich an Ihre Befehle gehalten, wären die Schäden an den Konvoischiffen erheblich geringer ausgefallen. Auch wenn man Ihnen als Staffelführer eine gewisse Befehlsgewalt übertragen hat, gibt Ihnen das noch nicht das Recht, die Anweisungen des Oberkommandos zu ignorieren. Dieses Vorkommnis wird in Ihrem Führungszeugnis festgehalten."

958, "Treibstoff"

959, "Futtermittel"

960, "Verteidigen Sie den Konvoi"

961, "Zerstören Sie den Geschützturm"

962, "Zerstören Sie die Maelstrom"

963, "Zerstören Sie die Capricorn"

964, "Beschützen Sie Parracombe, Jooyun und Avila"

965, "Vernichten Sie alle Wachen"

966, "Vernichten Sie alle gegnerischen Jäger"

967, "Vernichten Sie alle gegnerischen Bomber"

968, "Die NTC Maelstrom ist in das Asteroidenfeld eingeflogen! Wenn sie in Recihweite kommt, wird der Kreuzer mit seiner Bug-Strahlkanone das Feuer auf den Konvoi eröffnen! Alpha 1, Sie müssen diesen Geschützturm ausschalten."

969, "Ihr Primärziel ist es, dem Konvoi Geleitschutz zu geben. Lassen Sie sich nicht von den Rebellen fortlocken."

970, "Hier spricht die GTC Parapet. Wir haben Befehl, den Capella-Sprungknoten zu blockieren und dürfen uns nicht von der Stelle rühren. Wir werden aber eine Staffel Perseus-Jäger zur Verstärkung schicken. Viel Glück, Piloten."

971, "Hier spricht die GTVA Colossus. Wir haben den Rendezvouspunkt erreicht. Setzen Transporter aus. Theta-Staffel, halten Sie Wache."

972, "Danke für den Geleitschutz, Alpha-Staffel."

973, "Die Rebellen haben die Parracombe zerstört!"

974, "Wir haben die Avila verloren! Wiederhole: Wir haben die Avila verloren!"

975, "Die Jooyun ist zerstört worden. Das wird den Vasudanern nicht gefallen."

976, "Gut gemacht, Pilot. Das Hauptgeschütz der Maelstrom ist damit ausgeschaltet."

977, "Achten Sie auf Ihren Abstand zum Konvoi, Pilot."

978, "An alle Einheiten in der Umgebung des Capella-Sprungknotens: Mayday! Unser Konvoi wird angegriffen! Wiederhole: Unser Konvoi wird angegriffen!"

979, "Wir fliegen jetzt in das Asteroidenfeld, Command. Wir sind etwa dreiundzwanzig Kilometer vom Capella-Sprungknoten entfernt."

980, "Ich empfange feindliche Anzeichen auf meinem Radar. Ich kann aber kein Ziel erfassen. Könnten auch nur Störungen durch Asteroiden sein."

981, "Das ist reines Wunschdenken, Pilot. Gehen Sie vorsichtig vor und bleiben Sie dicht beim Konvoi."

982, "Command, ein Sperrgeschütz wurde aktiviert, nur tausend Meter vom Konvoi!"

983, "Zerstören Sie sie, aber seien Sie vorsichtig, Alpha. Die NTF scheint einen Hinterhalt vorzubereiten. Achten Sie auf feindliche Jäger."

984, "Die Rebellen haben ihre Medusa-Bomber starten lassen! Fangen Sie sie ab, bevor sie ihre Raketen abschiessen können. Wir müssen den Konvoi beschützen!"

985, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten! Wir haben die Maelstrom zerstört!"

986, "Hier spricht die GVG Jooyun. Wir brauchen dringend Jagdschutz! An alle alliierten Schiffe im Sektor: Erbitten Hilfe!"

987, "Avila hier! Erbitten dringend Hilfe, Piloten! Rumpfzustand ist im roten Bereich!"

988, "Hier spricht die Parracombe! Wir werden hier zusammengeschossen! Unser Rumpf kann keinen direkten Treffer mehr wegstecken!"

989, "Der Konvoi ist vernichtet! Sofort zurück zum Stützpunkt."

990, "Alpha, die Situation ist jetzt unter Kontrolle. Sie können zum Stützpunkt zurückkehren."

991, "Finte! Parade! En Garde!"

992, "Das 242. greift zwei Rebellenkreuzer und ihren Geleitschutz an, um die NTD Repulse in eine Falle zu locken."

993, "Die Allianz geht jetzt mit der $f Colossus in die Offensive. Wir wollen der Rebellenflotte in Epsilon Pegasi das Rückgrat brechen, und das 242. wird eine wichtige Rolle dabei spielen. Irgendwo in diesem System steckt Konteradmiral Koth. Er wird mit der $h Repulse nicht eingreifen, solange es nicht unumgänglich ist. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, genau dieses Eingreifen unumgänglich zu machen..."

994, "Um Koth in unsere Falle zu locken, werden wir im ersten Teil unseres Einsatzes die Rebellenkreuzer $h Majestic und $h Refute angreifen. Sie werden von einem Geleitschutz aus zwölf Jägern der Hercules-Klasse beschützt. Dank der Geschwindigkeit und Wendigkeit des Perseus sollten Sie in der Lage sein, die Hercs auszumanövrieren und abzuschiessen."

995, "Ihr vorrangiges Ziel ist die Vernichtung der Jägereskorte. Das bereitet der $f GTC $f Rampart und unseren Bomberstaffeln den Weg, die den Hauptschlag führen werden. Unser Plan ist es, die gegnerischen Kreuzer zu bedrohen, aber gleichzeitig als kleine, verstreute Einheit dazustehen."

996, "Wenn die Rebellen nämlich glauben, dass sie es nur mit einem Leviathan und ein paar verstreuten Bombern zu tun haben, wollen sie ihre Übermacht vielleicht ausnutzen und schicken den Rest der Flotte los. Aus diesem Grund dürfen die Kreuzer nicht zerstört werden, solange ihre Verstärkungen nicht eingetroffen sind."

997, "Wenn Koth die Repulse schickt, um uns niederzukämpfen, wird das Oberkommando die $f Colossus einsetzen, um den vernichtenden Schlag zu führen. Ihr Sekundärziel in dieser Phase ist es, die $f Rampart zu beschützen. Der Kreuzer wird dann wahrscheinlich schon Schäden aus den ersten Schusswechseln erlitten haben. Viel Glück, Alpha."

998, "Die Allianz hat bei Epsilon Pegasi einen entscheidenden Sieg errungen. Nachdem unsere Blockade des Polaris-Sprungknotens stand, haben sich alle Rebellenschiffe im System ergeben. In Anerkennung Ihrer Verdienste bei diesem alliierten Sieg verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit die Epsilon Pegasi Befreiungsmedaille. Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat und die Generalversammlung danken Ihnen für Ihren Einsatz. 

Admiral Petrarch sucht herausragende Piloten für das 134. Barracuda-Geschwader, eine Kampferprobungseinheit. Ich habe Sie als hervorragenden Kandidaten empfohlen. Die Hauptaufgabe des 134. ist die Erprobung neuer Technologien im Gefechtseinsatz. Meiner Meinung nach sind Sie für diese schwierige Aufgabe wie geschaffen. 

Andererseits habe ich aber auch gehört, dass das Sondereinsatzkommando einen Freiwilligen für eine extrem gefährliche Operation sucht. Wenn Sie diese Aufgabe reizt, wird Ihr Job beim 134. bis zu Ihrer Rückkehr für Sie freigehalten. Die Entscheidung liegt bei Ihnen, Pilot."

999, "Die Allianz hat bei Epsilon Pegasi einen entscheidenden Sieg errungen. Nachdem unsere Blockade des Polaris-Sprungknotens stand, haben sich alle Rebellenschiffe im System ergeben. Die 242. Suicide Kings haben trotzdem wenig Grund zum Feiern. 

Die Vernichtung der Rampart wirft ein schlechtes Licht auf unsere Einheit und auf Ihre Führungsqualitäten. Das Oberkommando verlässt sich darauf, das unsere Abfanggeschwader unsere Kriegsschiffe beschützen. Als Staffelführer müssen Sie lernen, wie man die Initiative ergreift, wie man eine Krise analysiert und wie man seine Staffelkameraden einsetzt. 

Ich habe Ihre sofortige Versetzung zu den 134. Barracudas empfohlen, einer Kampferprobungseinheit. In solch einem Geschwader hat ein Versagen nicht so schreckliche Folgen wie bei einer Kampfeinheit. Andererseits habe ich aber auch gehört, dass das Sondereinsatzkommando einen Freiwilligen für eine Selbstmordmission sucht. Diese Entscheidung liegt natürlich ganz bei Ihnen, Pilot."

1000, "Konzentrieren Sie sich auf die Einsatzziele. Verschwenden Sie keine Zeit mit der Jagd auf einzelne Jäger. Nutzen Sie die Feuerkraft der grossen Schiffe, um schnell gegnerische Ziele auszuschalten."

1001, "Zerstören Sie die Eskorte"

1002, "Beschützen Sie die Rampart"

1003, "Vernichten Sie die Jäger-Eskorte des Kreuzers"

1004, "Verteidigen Sie die Rampart"

1005, "Helfen Sie mit, Koths Kampfverband zu vernichten"

1006, "Der Jäger-Geleitschutz wurde ausgeschaltet. Ziehen Sie sich zur Rampart zurück und fassen Sie neue Munition, wenn nötig, Alpha. Die Zeta-Staffel übernimmt jetzt. Wir wollen Sie lieber in Bereitschaft halten, falls neue Rebellen-Jäger eindringen."

1007, "Alpha, Ihre wichtigste Aufgabe ist es, den Geleitschutz abzufangen. Die Rebellen-Kreuzer haben Jägerabwehrgeschütze. Halten Sie sich ausserhalb der Reichweite!"

1008, "Hier spricht die GTC Rampart. Wir schalten die Hauptgeschütze runter, um weitere Schäden an den Kreuzern zu vermeiden. Wenn wir sie aus Versehen zerstören, sind wir aufgeflogen."

1009, "Hier Zeta-Staffel. Haben unser Päckchen abgegeben, kehren zum Stützpunkt zurück."

1010, "Iota-Staffel hier. Wenn wir diese Kreuzer noch mehr zusammenschiessen, haben wir keinen Köder mehr für unsere Falle. Wir verziehen uns."

1011, "Rampart fährt Primärbatterien hoch. Unsere Strahlgeschütze sind wieder einsatzbereit."

1012, "Die Sensoren erfassen eine Staffel Rebellen-Lokis, Zielbezeichnung Libra. Suchen und vernichten."

1013, "Seien Sie vorsichtig, Alpha. Diese Jägerabwehrgeschütze haben eine effektive Reichweite von fünfzehnhundert Metern. Locken Sie also den Geleitschutz von den Kreuzern weg"

1014, "Diese Operation ist der Anfang vom Ende der NTF. Gut gemacht, Piloten."

1015, "Hier spricht die GTVA Colossus. Admiral Koth, wir befehlen Ihnen, sofort die Schiffsenergie abzuschalten und sich zu ergeben. Der Polaris-Sprungknoten ist blockiert, es gibt kein Entkommen!"

1016, "Ich habe nicht die Absicht, zu fliehen, Colossus, und ebensowenig werde ich mich ergeben. Selbst wenn ich dafür meine Mannschaft mit Ihnen zur Hölle schicken muss, werde ich diese Monstrosität jetzt vernichten!"

1017, "Die Repulse geht auf Kollisionskurs mit der Colossus!"

1018, "Admiral Koths Zerstörer, die NTD Repulse, ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht!! Der grosse Fisch hat unseren Köder geschluckt. Jetzt können wir die Colossus einsetzen."

1019, "Sprungsignatur nähert sich! Es sind Verbündete... die Colossus! Sie ist jetzt bereit!"

1020, "Die Repulse setzt ihre Jäger-Staffeln aus. Alpha, Sie müssen uns helfen...zerstören Sie die Aries-Staffel!"

1021, "Seien Sie nicht albern, Koth! Sie opfern zehntausend Menschenleben für nichts!"

1022, "Ich finde Ihren Zynismus abstossend, Colossus. Ich habe hier zehntausend Offiziere und Mannschaften, die bereit sind, für Neo-Terra zu sterben! Die Tyrannei Ihres Regimes endet jetzt! Admiral Koth, Ende!"

1023, "Vorderdecks vierhundert bis zwölfhundert sofort evakuieren. Geschütztürme in Stellung. Behelfsbrücke in Bereitschaft. Alle Mann auf Einschlag vorbereiten!"

1024, "Zielobjekt Repulse ausgeschaltet. Colossus, wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus?"

1025, "Nur minimale Schäden bei uns, Command. Wenn Koth sich ergeben hätte statt den Märtyrer zu spielen, dann könnte seine Mannschaft jetzt noch leben."

1026, "Die Gegend ist gesichert. Alle feindlichen Ziele wurden ausgeschaltet. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1027, "Die NTC Majestic ist zerstört worden!"

1028, "Wir haben die NTC Refute ausgeschaltet!"

1029, "Hier spricht die GTC Rampart! Wir haben schwere Treffer abbekommen. Alle Systeme fast im roten Bereich!"

1030, "Wir haben die Rampart verloren! Ich wiederhole! Wir haben die Rampart verloren!"

1031, "Die Geleitschutz-Jäger stürzen sich auf Sie, Alpha. Locken Sie sie zurück zur Rampart."

1032, "Schlacht in der Wildnis"

1033, "Die 134. Barracudas geben bei diesem ersten Nebel-Einsatz der AWACS-Schiffe zwei Frachtern Geleitschutz"

1034, "Neuigkeiten von der Front

Um 21.50 ist die Colossus ins Polaris System eingeflogen und hat die NTD Andronicus und die NTC Camisard unschädlich gemacht. Der Sprungknoten von Epsilon Pegasi wurde damit gesichert. In der Zwischenzeit hat der 13. Vasudanische Kampfverband die NTD Cyrene zerstört und einen Brückenkopf im Sirius erobert. Geheimdienstberichte weisen darauf hin, dass Admiral Bosch und seine Elitegarde sich auf die Rebellenenklave von Regulus zurückgezogen haben.

Command geht von einem völligen Sieg der Allianz innerhalb von 30 Tagen aus."

1035, "Dr. Hargroves Forschungsgruppe hat herausgefunden, dass dieses Subraumportal in Gamma Draconis eine Konstruktion der sogenannten 'Uralten' ist, einer ausgestorbenen Zivilisation, die gegen Ende des Grossen Krieges entdeckt wurde. Artefakte, die im Altair-System ausgegraben wurden, enthielten Daten, mit deren Hilfe die GTA und die PVN damals die SD Lucifer zerstören konnten. Viele terranische und vasudanische Systeme gehörten einst zum Imperium der Uralten, das vor achttausend Jahren von den Shivanern vernichtet wurde. Das Portal wurde auf den Namen Knossos getauft, in Erinnerung an die Minoerkultur der Erde."

1036, "Der Nachrichtendienst hat herausgefunden, dass Bosch in einer Ausgrabungsstätte im Deneb-System Material aus der Zeit der Uralten gefunden hat. Diese Artefakte ermöglichten es ihm, das Knossos-Portal zu finden und zu aktivieren. Das erklärt auch, was sein Kommandoschiff im Asteroidengürtel von Deneb zu suchen hatte. Bosch hat dann die NTC Trinity nach Gamma Draconis geschickt, um das Portal zu aktivieren, was die Shivaner in das System lockte.

Wir kennen weder Boschs Motive noch wissen wir, was die Shivaner im Nebelgebiet zu suchen haben."

1037, "Neuer Kontakt

Die alliierten Wissenschaftler, die das Portal untersuchen, sind optimistisch, was das Potential dieser Technologie angeht. In fünf bis zehn Jahren könnten wir in der Lage sein, wieder Kontakt zur Erde aufzunehmen oder neue Sprungknoten zu unerforschten Regionen der Galaxis herzustellen. Aus diesem Grund müssen wir das Portal so lange wie möglich offenhalten.

Command hat aber auch den Befehl gegeben, das Gerät zu zerstören, sofern dort ein Grossangriff bevorsteht."

1038, "Nach der Vernichtung der Ravana hat sich die shivanische Aktivität im Nebelgebiet verstärkt. Die shivanische Flotte scheint kleiner zu sein als die Armada, die wir vor drei Jahrzehnten besiegt haben, und unsere verbesserte Technologie gibt uns einen taktischen Vorteil. Doch aufgrund der Möglichkeit, dass noch mehr uns unbekannte Sprungknoten existieren, die in weitere von Shivanern besetzte Systeme führen, können wir die tatsächliche Stärke der gegnerischen Kräfte nicht einmal abschätzen.

Ein einziger Fehler unsererseits könnte eine zweite shivanische Invasion unserer Heimatsysteme auslösen."

1039, "Die Aquitaine wird die nächste Phase unserer Erkundungs- und Abwehroperationen im Nebelgebiet leiten. Dazu stellt uns die Allianz ihre neuesten Technologien zu Verfügung, wie etwa das Frühwarnsystem AWACS sowie Gassammler-Schiffe vom Typ Miner, mit denen wir Deuterium für unsere Fusionsreaktoren sammeln können. 

Prototypen neuer taktischer Waffensysteme und Jägerklassen werden erst nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss von Tests unter Gefechtsbedingungen zum Einsatz freigegeben. Die 134. Barracudas führen diese Versuche in der Nähe des Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknotens durch."

1040, "Der GTW ML-70 Morgenstern-Werfer

Zwei Waffen der nächsten Generation sind jetzt einsatzbereit: der Morgenstern-Werfer und die EMP-Rakete. Der GTW ML-70 Morgenstern ist eine Verbesserung des Breitschwert-Geschützes, das während des Grossen Krieges entwickelt worden ist. Dank bahnbrechender Fortschritte im Bereich der Hochtemperatur-Optik kann die primäre Fokuskammer des Morgensterns eine viel kohärentere Ladung erzeugen. Daher hat ein Einschlag, obwohl es sich ja immer noch um eine Energiewaffe handelt, eine starke kinetische Wirkung auf das Ziel."

1041, "Die SM2-01 EMP-Rakete

Die EMP-Rakete stört die elektronischen Systeme aller Schiffe in ihrem Detonationsradius. Die Schockwelle löscht Zieldaten und unterbricht jegliche elektronische Kommunikation. Dadurch wird die EMP auch zu einer exzellenten taktischen Waffe gegen Bomberangriffe, denn sie verhindert, dass diese Schiffe ein Ziel erfassen können und bringt die Navigations- und Antriebssysteme bereits abgefeuerter Raketen zum Absturz."

1042, "Willkommen bei den 134. Barracudas, Pilot. Ich bin Commander Vincey, Ihr Geschwaderführer. Das 134. ist eine Kampferprobungseinheit, was nichts anderes bedeutet, als dass wir als Erste neue Waffen und Schiffe unter Gefechtsbedingungen einsetzen dürfen. Während wir unsere Einsätze fliegen, sammeln die Ingenieure Daten über die Systeme, die wir testen sollen."

1043, "Bei diesem Einsatz ist unsere Hauptaufgabe, zwei Frachtern der Triton-Klasse Geleitschutz zu geben, der $f Erinpura und der $f Vauban. Sie werden am Gamma-Draconis-Knoten in den Nebel einfliegen und sich zu ihrem Zielpunkt begeben, wo sie auf die $f GTCv $f Warspite treffen. Ihre Ladung besteht aus einem neuen Zielerfassungs- und Raketenlenksystem namens TAG."

1044, "Die $f GTA $f Lucidity wird bei diesem Einsatz AWACS-Unterstützung bieten. Mit ihren mächtigen Sensoren kann die $f Lucidity Zieldaten direkt zu Ihrem Jäger übertragen, wodurch sich Ihre Sensorenreichweite effektiv vergrössert. Das 134. ist das erste Geschwader, das diese Technik im Nebel testet."

1045, "Denken Sie nur immer an die erste Silbe in dem Wort 'Kampferprobungseinheit'. Wir führen hier keine kontrollierten Laborexperimente durch. Die shivanischen Aktivitäten in der Gegend haben zugenommen, also richten Sie sich auf ein Zusammentreffen mit ein paar Maras und Cains ein. Wenn es Ihnen zu haarig wird da draussen, können Sie jederzeit Verstärkung anfordern. Viel Glück, Pilot."

1046, "Unser Geschwader hat die Erinpura verloren, die Vauban und die Prototypen des TAG-Raketenlenksystems. Jetzt wird nicht nur die Erprobung des Raketenlenksystems ausfallen, das Oberkommando hat auch eine genaue Untersuchung des Vorfalles angeordnet. In diesem Moment untersuchen die Systemanalytiker bereits die Daten unserer Flugschreiber. Das gesamte Geschwader hat bis zum Ende dieser Untersuchung Flugverbot. 

Das Oberkommando wertet den Einsatz des AWACS als völligen Fehlschlag."

1047, "Es ist überaus wichtig, dass Sie sich auf die gegnerischen Bomber konzentrieren. Sie haben ja auch Verstärkungen zur Verfügung; nutzen Sie sie gut!"

1048, "Obwohl wir bei diesem Gefecht einen Frachter verloren haben, wird die Erprobung der TAG-Raketen unter Gefechtsbedingungen wie geplant weitergehen. Das 134. wird diesen Test zusammen mit der Warspite durchführen. 

Die Zerstörung des AWACS-Schiffes hat auch eine kritische Schwachstelle in unserem Plan aufgezeigt. Obwohl das AWACS unsere Sensorenreichweite vergrössert, beschränkt seine Verletzlichkeit doch seine Nützlichkeit in Gefechtssituationen. Andererseits war es Ihre Einheit, die beim Schutz des AWACS-Schiffes versagt hat; vielleicht ist nur eine effektivere Staffelführung nötig."

1049, "Sowohl die Erinpura als auch die Vauban haben den shivanischen Angriff überstanden. Die Erprobung der TAG-Raketen unter Gefechtsbedingungen wird wie geplant weitergehen. Das 134. wird diesen Test zusammen mit der Warspite durchführen. Die Zerstörung des AWACS-Schiffes hat auch eine kritische Schwachstelle in unserem Plan aufgezeigt. Obwohl das AWACS unsere Sensorenreichweite vergrössert, beschränkt seine Verletzlichkeit doch seine Nützlichkeit in Gefechtssituationen. Andererseits war es Ihre Einheit, die beim Schutz des AWACS-Schiffes versagt hat; vielleicht ist nur eine effektivere Staffelführung nötig."

1050, "Sowohl die Erinpura als auch die Vauban haben den shivanischen Angriff überstanden. Die Erprobung der TAG-Raketen unter Gefechtsbedingungen wird wie geplant weitergehen. Das 134. wird diesen Test zusammen mit der Warspite durchführen.

Das Oberkommando wertet den Einsatz des AWACS als vollen Erfolg. Unsere erweiterte Sensorenreichweite hat uns einen entscheidenden taktischen Vorteil verschafft, so dass wir schnell und entschlossen auf den shivanischen Angriff reagieren konnten. 

Machen Sie Ihre Staffel bereit für den nächsten Einsatz, Pilot. Der Test der TAG-Raketen beginnt um 03.15 Standardzeit."

1051, "Sie sind einen ausgezeichneten Einsatz geflogen."

1052, "Unser Geschwader hat die Erinpura verloren, die Vauban und die Prototypen des TAG-Raketenlenksystems. Jetzt wird nicht nur die Erprobung des Raketenlenksystems ausfallen, das Oberkommando hat auch eine genaue Untersuchung des Vorfalles angeordnet. In diesem Moment untersuchen die Systemanalytiker bereits die Daten unserer Flugschreiber. Das gesamte Geschwader hat bis zum Ende dieser Untersuchung Flugverbot.

1053, "Obwohl wir bei diesem Gefecht einen Frachter verloren haben, wird die Erprobung der TAG-Raketen unter Gefechtsbedingungen wie geplant weitergehen. Das 134. wird diesen Test zusammen mit der Warspite durchführen. 

Das Oberkommando wertet den Einsatz des AWACS als teilweisen Erfolg. Unsere erweiterte Sensorenreichweite hat uns einen entscheidenden taktischen Vorteil verschafft, so dass wir schnell auf den shivanischen Angriff reagieren konnten."

1059, "Command, hier Alpha-Staffel. Wir sind auf unserem Posten am Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten."

1060, "Wir schicken jetzt die Transporter rein, Alpha."

1061, "Lucidity hier. Die AWACS sind in Betrieb. Wir orten Feindkräfte in grosser Entfernung."

1062, "In Ordnung. Schalten IFF um und kommen zu Ihnen."

1063, "Warspite, hier spricht die Lucidity. Wir nähern uns dem Rendezvouspunkt. Bitte aktivieren Sie Ihren IFF-Sender."

1064, "Warspite, hier spricht die Vauban. Wir haben usere AWACS-Unterstützung verloren. Erbitten sofortige Hilfe."

1065, "Beta-Staffel in Bereitschaft. Verstärkung nach Bedarf verfügbar, Alpha."

1066, "Die Shivaner haben es auf unser AWACS-System abgesehen. Wir brauchen sofort Jagdschutz!"

1067, "Das AWACS ist ausgefallen. Wir versuchen, die Sensoren wieder zu reparieren."

1068, "Hier spricht die Lucidity. Wir haben jetzt nur noch begrenzte AWACS-Fahigkeiten. Die Reparaturen sind im Gange."

1069, "AWACS wieder auf voller Leistung."

1070, "Die Sensoren sind wieder ausgefallen! Chance auf eine Reparatur vor Ort liegt unter fünf Prozent."

1071, "Alpha, unsere Sensoren haben einen Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse erfasst. Rufen Sie die Zeta-Staffel herbei, wenn Sie Verstärkung brauchen."

1072, "Danke, Alpha! Wir übernehmen ab jetzt."

1073, "Alle entdeckten gegnerischen Schiffe sind ausgeschaltet. Alpha-Staffel, zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1074, "Alpha, helfen Sie der Warspite, diesen Bereich zu sichern. Zerstören Sie alle gegnerischen Schiffe in Reichweite."

1075, "Der Konvoi, den Sie beschützen sollten, ist vernichtet worden. Alpha, sofort zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1076, "Die Erinpura und die Vauban wurden zerstört. Eskortieren Sie die Lucidity zur Warspite, und kehren Sie dann zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1077, "Wir orten eine neue Staffel im Anflug, Zielbezeichnung Cancer. Schalten Sie sie aus, Alpha!"

1078, "Aufgepasst, da kommt eine gegnerische Staffel rein!"

1079, "Gegner im Anflug!"

1080, "Wir bekommen Gesellschaft."

1081, "Zielübungen"

1082, "Das 134. testet das neuen TAG-Lenkraketensystem"

1083, "Das 134. wird sich jetzt an der Erprobung der TAG-Rakete unter Gefechtsbedingungen beteiligen. Captain Forsythe von der Warspite hat Sie extra für diese Aufgabe angefordert. Offenbar haben Sie ihn bei Ihrem letzten Einsatz sehr beeindruckt. Die Warspite wird diesen Test beobachten und koordinieren."

1084, "Das 134. wird sich jetzt an der Erprobung der TAG-Rakete beteiligen. Dies ist der erste Einsatz der neuen Waffe unter Gefechtsbedingungen. Unsere Laborsimulationen weisen darauf hin, dass sie ein deutliches Potential als taktische Waffe besitzt."

1085, "Wenn Sie ein Ziel mit der TAG-Rakete treffen, sendet ihr Gefechtskopf einen Richtstrahl aus, den alle alliierten Grosskampfschiffe in Reichweite als Zielpeilung verwenden können. So wird die gesamte verfügbare Feuerkraft auf ein Ziel gebündelt. Diese Technologie könnte uns einen klaren Vorteil gegenüber dem Feind verschaffen. In dieser Übung testen wir den Prototypen TAG-A."

1086, "Das Oberkommando hat Erkundungsstaffeln zu den shivanischen Flottenverbänden ausgeschickt. Sie werden Ziele in die Reichweite unserer Geschütze locken. Sobald sich der Gegner nähert, setzen Sie sich schnell hinter die Ziele und feuern Sie Ihre TAGs ab. Um die maximale Wirkung zu erzielen, bleiben Sie in 3000 Metern Umkreis um die Korvette. Die $f Lucidity sorgt für AWACS-Unterstützung."

1087, "Das Oberkommando hat Erkundungsstaffeln zu den shivanischen Flottenverbänden ausgeschickt. Sie werden Ziele in die Reichweite unserer Geschütze locken. Sobald sich der Gegner nähert, setzen Sie sich schnell hinter die Ziele und feuern Sie Ihre TAGs ab. Um die maximale Wirkung zu erzielen, bleiben Sie in 3000 Metern Umkreis um die Korvette."

1088, "Bei diesem Einsatz werden Sie einen umgebauten Ulysses-Raumüberlegenheitsjäger fliegen, der speziell die diese Übung modifiziert worden ist. Der Ulysses ist eine Antiquität aus den Tagen des Grossen Krieges, aber der Jäger fliegt sich immer noch sehr gut, und dank der Umbauten können die TAG-Ingenieure den Verlauf des Einsatzes überwachen."

1089, "Auch wenn dieser Einsatz nicht so ablief wie geplant, hat das 134. sich der Herausforderung gestellt und unsere Kriegsschiffe bewundernswert verteidigt. 

Insgesamt hat der Gefechtseinsatz der TAG-Rakete unsere Erwartungen noch übertroffen. Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsabteilung arbeitet jetzt an einigen Verbesserungen des TAG-A-Prototyps, wie etwa einem zielsuchenden Gefechtskopf und einem besser manövrierbaren Antriebssystem. Diese Verbesserungen sollten aus der TAG eine vielseitige Waffe für unsere taktischen Staffeln machen."

1090, "Die Zerstörung der Warspite war eine sinnlose Tragödie. Captain Forsythe und seine Mannschaft hätten ihr Leben nicht für eine Prototypen-Erprobung opfern müssen. Das 134. hatte den Auftrag, unsere Kriegsschiffe aus einer schwierigen Situation herauszuholen und hat dabei versagt. Als Führer der Alpha-Staffel sollten Sie sich dieses Szenario noch einmal gut durch den Kopf gehen lassen - was hätten Sie tun können, um die Warspite zu retten?"

1091, "Die müssen jede TAG-Rakete, die man Ihnen überlässt, mit Bedacht einsetzen. Da es sich um ungelenkte Raketen handelt, sollten Sie so nahe wie möglich an das Ziel herangehen. Sobald das Ziel mit der Rakete markiert ist, drehen Sie ab, damit Sie nicht in das Feuer der eigenen Schiffe geraten."

1092, "Die Zerstörung der Lucidity war eine sinnlose Tragödie. Die Mannschaft hätten ihr Leben nicht für eine Prototypen-Erprobung opfern müssen. Das 134. hatte den Auftrag, unsere Kriegsschiffe aus einer schwierigen Situation herauszuholen und hat dabei versagt. Als Führer der Alpha-Staffel sollten Sie sich dieses Szenario noch einmal gut durch den Kopf gehen lassen - was hätten Sie tun können, um die Lucidity zu retten?"

1093, "Das Ergebnis dieses Debakels ist der Verlust der Warspite und der Lucidity. Sie allein hatten die Chance, das zu verhindern. Doch statt dessen haben Sie unserem Geschwader Schande bereitet. Als Pilot in einer Gefechtserprobungs-Einheit müssen Sie mit jeder Herausforderung fertig werden. Die Entwicklung der TAG-Rakete wird bis auf weiteres eingestellt."

1094, "Gehen Sie erst dann in den Subraum, wenn es Ihnen befohlen wird."

1100, "Hier spricht Alpha-Staffel. Wir sind in Position und halten uns bereit."

1101, "Bestätigt. Unsere Aufklärer sind im Anflug, mit gegnerischen Jägern im Nacken. Anzahl der Gegner unbekannt."

1102, "Hier Scout 1! Ich verziehe mich! Die haben mich tierisch zusammengeschossen!"

1103, "Mayday! Mayday! Hier Scout 3! Eine grosse shivanische Flotte kommt auf Ihre Position zu! Ich stehe unter heftigem Beschuss!"

1104, "Alpha-Staffel, unser Feuerleitsystem ist jetzt völlig an Ihr Erfassungssystem gekoppelt. Wir können nur auf Schiffe schiessen, die Sie für uns erfassen. Was Sie nicht markieren, können wir nicht treffen."

1105, "Langstreckensensoren melden elf feindliche Schiffe im Anflug. Wir empfangen noch weitere Sprungsignaturen mit feindlicher Konfiguration."

1106, "An alle Einheiten! Das Geplänkel hier entwickelt sich langsam zu einer kleinen Raumschlacht. Die Iota-Staffel kommt so schnell wie möglich als Verstärkung an Ihre jetzige Position. Durchhalten, Alpha. Hilfe ist unterwegs."

1107, "Das ist nicht gut genug, Command! Wir sind nicht ausreichend bewaffnet hier draussen! Was sollen wir denn Ihrer Meinung nach tun?"

1108, "Wir sind uns im Klaren über Ihre Situation, Alpha. Wir sind uns aber auch darüber im Klaren, dass Tausende von Menschen an Bord der Warspite und der Lucidity sich auf Sie verlassen."

1109, "In Ordnung, Command. Wir werden den Job erledigen."

1110, "Alles erledigt, Einsatz erfolgreich abgeschlossen, Alpha. Sie können jetzt zum Stützpunkt zurückkehren."

1111, "Eine Staffel von fünf Taurvis ist im Anflug! Fangen Sie diese Bomber ab, Alpha!"

1112, "Hier Iota-Staffel. Stehen zur Verstärkung bereit."

1113, "Wir sind uns im Klaren über Ihre Situation, Alpha. Wir sind uns aber auch darüber im Klaren, dass Tausende von Menschen an Bord der Warspite sich auf Sie verlassen."

1114, "Hier spricht die Warspite! Stehen unter heftigem Beschuss! Alpha, wenn Sie die Angreifer nicht markieren, sind wir völlig hilflos!"

1115, "Die Shivaner haben die Warspite vernichtet!"

1116, "Wir brauchen Jagdschutz für die Lucidity! Wir dürfen die AWACS nicht verlieren!"

1117, "Die Lucidity ist zerstört worden!"

1118, "Alpha, augenblicklich zurück zum Stützpunkt. Dieser Einsatz ist vorbei."

1119, "Mayday! Mayday! Hier ist Kappa 3 von den 107. Ravens der GTD Aquitaine! Command, empfangen Sie mich?"

1120, "Bestätigt, Kappa 3! Wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus?"

1121, "Command, schaffen Sie die Flotte aus dem Nebel! Schliessen Sie sofort das Portal! Sie haben keine Zeit zu verlieren!"

1122, "Ich übertrage die Daten über die derzeitige Position der Aquitaine. Zurück zum Stützpunkt, schnell. Sie haben böse was abbekommen."

1123, "Hören Sie mir gut zu! Wir haben dieses Mal keine Chance, sie aufzuhalten! Schliessen Sie das Portal, bevor es zu spät ist! Da draussen ist etwas Schreckliches, Command! Bitte!!"

1124, "Kappa 3, empfangen Sie mich? Bitte antworten Sie. Ich wiederhole. Empfangen Sie mich?"

1125, "An alle Einheiten: Ignorieren Sie die Sendung von Kappa 3. Die Funkaufzeichnungen dieses Einsatzen unterliegen ab sofort der Geheimhaltungsstufe Phi."

1126, "Härtetest"

1127, "Das 134. nimmt an einer Gefechtserprobung der neuen Pegasus-Tarnkappenjäger teil."

1128, "Bei diesem Einsatz nimmt das 134. an der Erprobung des neuen Tarnkappenjägers der Pegasus-Klasse teil, der für alliierte Einsätze im Nebelgebiet entwickelt wurde. Das ungewöhnliche Design des Pegasus minimiert die elektromagnetische Silhouette des Jägers, so dass er von Sensoren so gut wie überhaupt nicht mehr erfasst wird. Diese Übung ist der erste Einsatz des Pegasus unter Gefechtsbedingungen im Nebelgebiet."

1129, "Staffel Alpha, unser Ziel ist es, die $f GTC $f Oberon zu beschützen, einen ausgemusterten Kreuzer der Fenris-Klasse. Die $f Oberon hat der Allianz seit dem Grossen Krieg gedient, und die meisten ihrer Systeme wurden inzwischen als Ersatzteile für andere Kreuzer ausgeschlachtet. Die $h Delta-Staffel wird die $f Oberon mit den Pegasus-Prototypen angreifen. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, sie zu verteidigen."

1130, "Ihre Waffen werden für die Dauer des Tests abgeschaltet. Sie können die Laser und Raketen zwar abfeuern, doch sie werden bei der $h Delta-Staffel nur oberflächliche Schäden anrichten. Die Ingenieure an Bord der $f GTD$f Aquitaine werden den Verlauf der Übung überwachen und Daten über die Tarnfähigkeit und das Kampfpotential des Pegasus sammeln."

1131, "Die Shivaner haben die Aquitaine zerstört. Ohne dieses Schiff sind all unsere Operationen im Nebelgebiet in Gefahr. Auch wenn der Gegner uns zahlenmässig und an Feuerkraft überlegen war, ist das keine Entschuldigung dafür, dass die Aquitaine unter unserem Schutz vernichtet wurde. Die 10.000 Offiziere und Mannschaftsmitglieder, die dabei ums Leben kamen, waren unsere Freunde und Kameraden. Das 134. ist der Schandfleck der alliierten Flotte. Da wir an der Front stehen, glauben die Befehlshaber, es sei unsere Pflicht, die Schuld für ihre Fehler auf uns zu nehmen. Als Ihr Geschwaderführer werde ich zu Ihren Gunsten aussagen. Man hätte mehr Staffeln einsetzen sollen, um den Rückzug der Aquitaine zu decken. Doch bis das Oberkommando seine Untersuchung abgeschlossen hat, wird Ihnen die Fluglizenz entzogen, und Sie werden unter Arrest gestellt. Sie können wegtreten, Pilot."

1132, "Ihre grösste Aufmerksamkeit sollten Sie auf Bomber richten, wenn Sie sie Aquitaine beschützen."

1133, "Gut gemacht, Pilot. Obwohl uns der Gegner uns zahlenmässig und an Feuerkraft überlegen war, haben Sie es geschafft, den Rückzug der Aquitaine durch den Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten zu decken. Die Moloch und ihre Jäger haben zwar schwere Schäden verursacht, doch unsere Wartungstrupps sind derzeit schon dabei, den Zerstörer wieder zusammenzuflicken. Ihre Handlungsweise hat Tausenden das Leben gerettet. 

Die 64. Raptors brauchen dringend gute Bomber-Piloten. Ich habe Sie zur Versetzung dorthin empfohlen. Einen Bomber zu fliegen ist harte Arbeit, aber mit einer Lafette voller Cyclops-Torpedos haben Sie dafür auch genug Feuerkraft, um gegnerische Korvetten und Zerstörer auszuschalten. 

Wir haben gerade die Nachricht bekommen, dass Bosch und seine Rebellenflotte unterwegs sind nach Gamma Draconis. Wir müssen so bald wie möglich wieder starten, um sie abzufangen. Admiral Petrarch wird um 21.50 Standardzeit Details zu unseren weiteren Plänen erläutern."

1134, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Obwohl uns der Gegner uns zahlenmässig und an Feuerkraft überlegen war, haben Sie es geschafft, den Rückzug der Aquitaine durch den Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten zu decken. Für die Rettung eines Grosskampfschiffes der Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Allianz vor der sicheren Vernichtung verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit den Orden von Galatea. Herzlichen Glückwunsch.

Admiral Petrarch wird um 21.50 Standardzeit Details zu unseren weiteren Plänen erläutern."

1135, "Sie hatten keine Erlaubnis, zum Stützpunkt zurückzufliegen. Durch Ihre Handlungsweise haben Sie eine Bewertung des Tarnkappenjägers Pegasus unmöglich gemacht. Bis auf weiteres haben Sie Startverbot!"

1136, "Um die Korvette der Moloch-Klasse zu zerstören, müssen Sie sie in Sensorreichweite halten. Damit liefern Sie der Aquitaine die nötigen Feuerleitdaten."

1145, "Diese Übung beginnt in 5...4...3...2...1. Delta-Staffel, Tarnmodus aktivieren."

1146, "Aquitaine, setzen Sie Kurz auf den Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten. Wir ziehen Sie von dort ab."

1147, "Alpha ist im Einsatz. Delta-Staffel, sind Sie bereit?"

1148, "Bestätigt, Command. Diese Alpha-Bubis werden nicht mal wissen, von wo aus wir sie getroffen haben."

1149, "Alpha, wir stellen Ihre Waffen auf den Trainingmodus um. Ihre Geschütze richten dann nur noch oberflächlichen Schaden an."

1150, "Bei allem nötigen Respekt, Sir, ich empfehle, diese Übung mit scharfer Munition durchzuführen."

1151, "Die Oberon ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht und hält sich bereit. Ihre Aufgabe, ist es, den Kreuzer gegen die Angriffe der Delta-Staffel zu verteidigen, Alpha."

1152, "Ziehen wir diese Fliegerchen aus dem Verkehr, Delta."

1153, "Erfassung der Testdaten läuft - jetzt. Alle Systeme funktionieren normal."

1154, "Da kommen sie!"

1155, "Bleiben Sie dran, Alpha! Nicht den Sichtkontakt verlieren!"

1156, "Zielsignatur ist verschwindend klein. Auf mittlere Reichweite kaum zu treffen."

1157, "Alpha, können Sie die Delta-Staffel als Ziel erfassen?"

1158, "Negativ, Command. Selbst auf kürzeste Entfernung fangen meine Sensoren kein Signal auf."

1159, "Gut. Wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus, Delta?"

1160, "Schilde und Panzerung haben einen niedrige Schadensschwelle."

1161, "Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit liegen weit über dem Durchschnitt."

1162, "Begrenzte Angriffsfähigkeiten. Meiner Meinung nach ein ausgezeichneter Aufklärungsjäger."

1163, "Die Delta-Staffel hat mässigen Schaden an der Oberon angerichtet. Bleiben Sie dran, Alpha. Verlieren Sie sie nicht im Nebel."

1164, "Die Oberon hat schwere Schäden erlitten. Die Jäger von Delta sind Ihnen wohl etwas überlegen, Alpha."

1165, "Der Zustand der Oberon liegt im roten Bereich, das Schiff ist verloren. Sieht aus wie ein Sieg für die Delta-Staffel."

1166, "Das reicht als erster Test, Piloten. Unsere Ingenieure haben wichtige Daten gesammelt. Gute Arbeit, Delta. Sie haben die Alpha-Staffel auf dem falschen Bein erwischt."

1167, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten. Unsere Ingenieure haben wichtige Daten gesammelt. Gute Arbeit, Alpha-Staffel."

1168, "Wir beginnen nun mit dem zweiten Test."

1169, "Übung abbrechen! Wiederhole: Übung abbrechen! Sensoren melden Feindschiffe im Anflug! Delta-Staffel, so schnell wie möglich zurück zur Aquitaine."

1170, "Alpha-Staffel, Ihre Primär- und Sekundärwaffen wurden wieder scharfgemacht. Halten Sie die Shivaner auf, damit sich die Aquitaine zurückziehen kann."

1171, "In Ordnung, Command. Fusionsantrieb wird gezündet. Entfernung vom Knoten beträgt 4500 Meter. Wir werden unseren Sprungpunkt in 6 Minuten erreichen."

1172, "Hier spricht die Aquitaine. Shivanische Gefechtsköpfe haben unseren Rumpf beschädigt. Ausserdem fügen uns die Hauptgeschütze der Moloch schweren Schaden zu."

1173, "Hier spricht die Aquitaine. Alle Mann vorbereiten auf Notevakuierung! Aussenhülle kann jeden Moment aufbrechen!"

1174, "Die Aquitaine ist zerstört worden! Einsatz abbrechen, Piloten! Ziehen Sie sich sofort zurück !"

1175, "Die Aquitaine hat den Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten erreicht! Sichern Sie die Gegend, und dann zurück zum Stützpunkt, Piloten. Gut gemacht."

1176, "Die Shivaner haben eine Korvette der Moloch-Klasse abgesetzt, Zielbezeichnung Tiamat."

1177, "Wir haben die Tiamat zerstört!"

1178, "Königs-Gambit"

1179, "Die 64. Raptors führen einen Bomberangriff auf die NTF-Kriegsschiffe, die die Blockade des Capella-Sprungknotens durchbrochen haben."

1180, "Boschs Gambit

Wir haben Berichte über alarmierende Entwicklungen an der Bürgerkriegsfront erhalten. Admiral Bosch hat seine Truppen im Regulus-System zusammengezogen und damit die Colossus mit ihrem Kampfverband ausmanövriert. Die Armada der Rebellen ist jetzt im Anflug auf das Gamma-Draconis-System, auf dem Weg über Polaris, Epsilon Pegasi und Capella.

Ihr Ziel: das Knossos-Subraumportal."

1181, "Spiessrutenlauf

Die alliierte Flotte hat einige NTF-Kriegsschiffe während ihres Spiessrutenlaufs durch die einzelnen Sprungknoten-Blockaden vernichten können. Trotzdem haben die Rebellen immer noch genug Feuerkraft, um unsere Positionen in Gamma Draconis zu bedrohen.

Die Colossus und ihr Kampfverband verfolgen Bosch und schiessen gelegentlich Nachzügler ab. Wir müssen Gamma Draconis halten, bis sie als Verstärkung eintrifft."

1182, "Auf die Barrikaden

Unsere Geschwader werden bei der Blockade des Capella-Sprungknotens mitwirken. Wenn die Rebellen ankommen, ist unser Hauptziel, so viel Schaden anzurichten wie möglich. In der zweiten Phase greifen wir dann Aufmarschgebiete des Gegners an, wenn die Rebellen versuchen, sich dort zum grossen Angriff zu sammeln.

Wir müssen die Angriffsstärke der NTF verringern, bevor es zur grossen Konfrontation am Sprungknoten kommt."

1183, "Das Ende der Rebellion

Dieser Feldzug könnte das Ende von Admiral Boschs Bewegung sein. Ob er nun zum Portal durchbricht oder nicht, das Regime der NTF und ihre Herrschaft über Polaris, Regulus und Sirius sind auf jeden Fall Vergangenheit. Das Oberkommando hat uns weder die Motive für Boschs Verhaltensweise mitgeteilt noch die möglichen Folgen, falls er Erfolg haben sollte.

Wir wissen nur, dass 18 Monate des Tötens und des Terrors jetzt bald enden werden."

1184, "Der Artemis-Bomber

Die Aquitaine hat soeben vier Staffeln der neuen GTB Artemis ausgeliefert bekommen, der nächsten Generation von Leichten Bombern. Die Artemis ist das beweglichste Schiff dieser Klasse und ist mit dem Cyclops-Torpedo bewaffnet, unserer modifizierten Kreuzer-Jagdwaffe. Ich habe die Maschinen den 64. Raptors zugewiesen. Dieses Geschwader wird bei der bevorstehenden Operation eine Rolle als Bomber- und schweres Angriffsgeschwader übernehmen."

1185, "Das Prometheus-S-Geschütz

Die Artemis-Bomber werden ab sofort auf das neue Prometheus-Geschütz umgerüstet. Unsere Gasextraktor-Schiffe im Nebelgebiet haben genug Rohmaterial gesammelt, dass wir mit der Produktion des GTW-5 Prometheus S beginnen können. Das S-Geschütz basiert auf der ursprünglichen Version des Prometheus-Geschützes, und das war mit seiner hohen Schadensquote bei Schild- und Rumpftreffern bekanntlich eine unserer besten Waffen im Grossen Krieg."

1186, "Hier spricht Commander Beckett, Anführer des 64. Bomber-Geschwaders. Um 04.57 Standardzeit sind Kriegsschiffe der NTF in das Gamma-Draconis-System eingedrungen und haben unsere Blockadeschiffe angegriffen. Bisher haben wir schon die NTC Absalon, die NTC Cunaxa und mehrere Truppentransporter abschiessen können. Admiral Petrarch hat das 64. zur Verstärkung herbeigerufen."

1187, "Die Vasudaner haben die Führung der Blockadetruppen übernommen mit der $f GVD $f Hedetet, einem Zerstörer der Typhon-Klasse. Die Allianz hat ausserdem ein Netz von fünf $f Mjolnir RBCs errichtet, ferngelenkten Strahlgeschützen. Diese unbemannten experimentellen Waffenplattformen feuern schwere Schiffsgeschütze auf gegnerische Kriegsschiffe ab und werden zur Verteidigung strategischer Ziele eingesetzt."

1188, "Die Flotte der $h NTF wird durch den Capella-Sprungknoten kommen. Danach springt jedes Kriegsschiff einen Sammelpunkt innerhalb des Gamma-Draconis-Systems an. In den Pausen zwischen den Sprüngen laden die Schiffe ihren Subraumantrieb wieder auf. Ihre Aufgabe wird darin bestehen, die Kriegsschiffe mit Ihren Cyclops-Torpedos anzufangen."

1189, "Die $h Iceni ist uns bereits durch die Finger geschlüpft, aber wir werden uns jede Mühe geben, Bosch zu finden, bevor die Rebellen sich sammeln und angreifen können. Geheimdienstberichten sind die $h NTD $h Uhuru, die $h NTC $h Pax, die $h NTC $h Liberty und die $h NTC $h Undaunted in den Subraumknoten eingeflogen und damit im Anflug auf unsere Blockade."

1190, "Die 64. Raptors sind eine Schande für die Aquitaine und die GTVA. Jedes Kriegsschiff, das unsere Blockade durchbricht, bedroht unsere Stellungen im Gamma-Draconis-System. Wir haben zwar die Kraft, die Rebellion zu zerschmettern, aber unser Versagen hier wird wertvolle Menschenleben und Ressourcen kosten, die nicht nötig gewesen wären. Admiral Petrarch hat dem 64. bis auf weiteres Flugverbot erteilt. Unsere Bomber wurden den 107. Ravens zugewiesen. Weggetreten, Pilot."

1191, "Konzentrieren Sie die Angriffe Ihrer Geschwaderkameraden auf wichtige Ziele."

1192, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Dank unserer Blockade des Capella-Sprungknotens hat die Allianz einen grossen Sieg errungen. Die Mjolnir RBCs und das Bombardement des 64. haben einen beträchtlichen Teil der Rebellenflotte ausgeschaltet. Die Raptors haben alle gegnerischen Kriegsschiffe ausgeschaltet, die durch unsere Linien geschlüpft sind. Kein anderes Geschwader kann das von sich behaupten. Unsere Einheit wird so schnell wie möglich wieder eingesetzt. Melden Sie sich sofort im Bereitschaftsraum."

1193, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot. Die Mjolnir RBCs und das Bombardement des 64. haben die Kampfkraft der Rebellenflotte beträchtlich verringert. Damit haben sich unsere Chancen verbessert, unsere Verluste bei Gamma Draconis auf einem Minimum zu halten. 

Die Raptors werden so schnell wie möglich wieder eingesetzt. Melden Sie sich sofort im Bereitschaftsraum."

1194, "Zerstören Sie die Uhuru"

1195, "Zerstören Sie die Pax"

1196, "Zerstören Sie die Liberty"

1197, "Zerstören Sie die Undaunted"

1198, "Zerstören Sie die Inspiration"

1199, "Zerstören Sie die Perseverance"

1200, "Fangen Sie alle NTF-Kampfschiffe ab, und zerstören Sie sie."

1201, "Aufgepasst, Alpha! NTF-Schiffe sind unterwegs zu Ihnen."

1202, "Die NTD Uhuru ist jetzt im System. Erledigen Sie den Zerstörer, und schalten Sie den Geleitschutz aus."

1203, "Gute Arbeit, Piloten! Aber noch kein Grund zu feiern, da kommt neuer Ärger auf uns zu."

1204, "Die NTD Uhuru ist gesprungen! Jetzt auf Kurs zum Sammelpunkt."

1205, "Alpha 1, eine Korvette der Deimos-Klasse, die NTCv Pax, ist ins System eingeflogen."

1206, "Die Pax hat es hinter sich!"

1207, "Die Pax ist entkommen! Das hier soll eine Blockade sein, Pilot! Wir müssen die Rebellen aus dem Verkehr ziehen!"

1208, "Die NTC Liberty fliegt in das System ein, ein Kreuzer der Aeolus-Klasse. Weichen Sie dem Loki-Geleitschutz aus, Alpha!"

1209, "Das ist ein bestätigter Abschuss! Aber da kommen noch mehr Gegner an!"

1210, "Vorsicht, Alpha! Die NTC Undaunted, ein Kreuzer der Leviathan-Klasse, mischt sich in das Gefecht ein."

1211, "Dranbleiben, Alpha. Die Schlacht ist noch nicht vorbei."

1212, "Die Undaunted ist geflohen. Jedes Schiff, das Sie entkommen lassen, bedeutet mehr Ärger für später, Pilot!"

1213, "Die Liberty ist in den Subraum gesprungen. Ich wette, wir sehen den Schrotthaufen bald wieder."

1214, "Da kommt die NTF Inspiration, Alpha. Schlagen Sie zu, aber feste!"

1215, "Zielobjekt Inspiration vernichtet. Halten Sie sich von dem Schiff fern, es geht gleich hoch!"

1216, "Die Inspiration hat die Blockade durchbrochen!"

1217, "Die NTCv Perseverance ist durch den Knoten geflogen!"

1218, "Die Perseverance ist vernichtet! Genau dafür werden Sie bezahlt, Pilot!"

1219, "Die Perseverance ist gesprungen. Das gibt verdammten Ärger, Piloten."

1220, "Alpha-Staffel, zurück zum Stützpunkt. Unsere Aufklärer haben einen Rebellen-Sammelpunkt gefunden, und wir teilen Sie dem Angriffstrupp zu."

1221, "Sizilianische Verteidigung"

1222, "Das 64. führt einen Präventivschlag gegen einen Sammelpunkt der Rebellen im Gamma-Draconis-System"

1223, "Unsere Aufklärer haben einen der NTF-Sammelpunkte im Gamma-Draconis-System gefunden. Die Rebellen bereiten sich auf einen koordinierten Angriff vor, um die Kontrolle über das Knossos-Subraum-Portal zu gewinnen. Der Geheimdienst glaubt, dass die NTF über ausreichende Feuerkraft für eine schwere Offensive verfügt."

1224, "Ihr Primärziel ist die $h Iceni, Boschs Kommandoschiff. Die 64. Raptors werden den Angriff anführen. Die Vasudaner setzen die $f GVC $f Hyksos und eine Staffel Serapis-Jäger zu unserer Unterstützung ein. Sobald wir weitere Schiffe zur Verfügung haben, werden wir sie als Verstärkung einsetzen."

1225, "Sie dürfen von nun ab die GTM-10 Piranha einsetzen, eine Synapsenbombe der dritten Generation. Die Piranha bildet einen hochexplosiven Jäger-Abwehrschirm. Zünden Sie die Piranhas durch erneutes Drücken des Feuerknopfes."

1226, "Sie haben sich gegen erbitterten Widerstand durchgekämpft und die Rebellenflotte angeschlagen. Die NTF hat mit ihrem Angriff auf das Knossos-Subraum-Portal begonnen, aber die Schläge, die unser Geschwader geführt hat, haben die Kampfkraft des Gegners bedeutend geschwächt. Unsere Angriffe auf die anderen Sammelpunkte waren ebenfalls erfolgreich, auch wenn Admiral Bosch weiter auf freiem Fuss ist. Trotzdem: Dies ist der Anfang vom Ende der NTF."

1227, "Dass wir es nicht geschafft haben, den gegnerischen Kriegsschiffen nennenswerten Schaden zuzufügen, könnte uns bei der Verteidigung des Knossos-Subraum-Portals noch bitter leid tun. Unsere Angriffe auf die anderen Sammelpunkte waren ebenfalls wenig erfolgreich. Auch wenn die Neo-Terranische Front kurz vor dem Zusammenbruch steht, können wir es uns nicht leisten, Bosch und seine Anhänger zu unterschätzen."

1228, "Koordinieren Sie Ihre Aktionen mit denen Ihrer Geschwaderkameraden. Konzentrieren Sie Ihre Kräfte auf die wichtigen Ziele."

1229, "Wir trauern um den Verlust unserer Schiffe und ihrer tapferen Besatzungen. Viele Menschen haben in dieser Schlacht ihr Leben gelassen, und wir hätten das vielleicht verhindern können, wenn wir wachsamer gewesen wären. Wir werden Bosch und die Neo-Terranische Front letztendlich besiegen, doch der Preis für diesen Sieg hätte nicht so hoch ausfallen müssen. Und ein Sieg in diesem Bürgerkrieg bedeutet noch lange keinen Frieden für die Allianz. Wir haben immer noch die Shivaner am Hals, und für die brauchen wir jedes Kriegsschiff in unserer Armada."

1230, "Setzen Sie Ihre Staffelpiloten ein, um verbündete Schiffe zu beschützen."

1231, "Das Oberkommando ist froh, dass wir es geschafft haben, unsere Verluste bei diesem Einsatz auf einem Minimum zu halten. Wir werden Bosch und die Neo-Terranische Front besiegen, obwohl ein Sieg in diesem Bürgerkrieg noch keinen Frieden für die Allianz bedeutet. Wir haben immer noch die Shivaner am Hals, und für die brauchen wir jedes Kriegsschiff in unserer Armada."

1232, "Zerstören Sie die Yoshitomo"

1233, "Vernichten Sie die Alba"

1234, "Zerstören Sie die Vindicator"

1235, "Zerstören Sie die Epigoni"

1236, "Zerstören Sie die Venture"

1237, "Zerstören Sie die Rebellenschiffe"

1238, "Ich habe ein Bild von der Vindicator, aber von der Iceni ist weit und breit nichts zu sehen."

1239, "Command, wir haben hier ein Problem."

1240, "Wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus, Beta?"

1241, "Entweder haben die Aufklärer Mist gebaut, oder Bosch ist bereits gesprungen."

1242, "Sollen wir unseren Angriff abbrechen, Command?"

1243, "Die Aufklärer werden die Iceni finden. Halten Sie die Augen auf, falls Bosch von einem anderen Sammelpunkt aus hereingesprungen kommt."

1244, "In Ordnung, Command. Wir schnappen sie uns!"

1245, "Hier spricht die Epsilon-Staffel des 33. Jägergeschwaders, GVD Memphis. Wir eskortieren die Hyksos in Position."

1246, "Piloten, die NTC Alba hat unsere Blockade am Capella-Sprungknoten durchbrochen. Wir haben sie bis zu Ihrem Sammelpunkt verfolgen können. Die Alba wird jeden Moment aus dem Subraum auftauchen."

1247, "Negativ, Piloten. Zerstören Sie die Vindicator. Schalten Sie alle Rebellenschiffe aus, die den Sammelpunkt erreichen. Wir fangen Bosch am Portal ab."

1248, "Command, wir brauchen hier draussen mehr Feuerkraft!"

1249, "Wir setzen die Delta-Staffel und die GTC Diomedes als Verstärkung ein. Bitte warten Sie."

1250, "Hier spricht die Diomedes. Greife die Rebellen jetzt an."

1251, "Ein Kreuzer der Aeolus-Klasse ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht! Achten Sie auf die Flakgeschütze des Schiffes, Piloten!"

1252, "Die Yoshitomo ist ausgeschaltet!"

1253, "Wir haben die Alba zerstört!"

1254, "Wir haben die Vindicator vernichtet!"

1255, "Wir haben die Hyksos verloren!"

1256, "Die Rebellen haben die Diomedes abgeschossen!"

1257, "Die Vindicator verlässt das System! Die Rebellen beginnen ihren Angriff. Einsatz abbrechen und zurück zum Stützpunkt, Piloten!"

1258, "Die Vindicator beginnt mit ihrem Subraumsprung! Kein Grund zur Sorge, Piloten. Ich glaube, wir haben sie hart genug getroffen."

1259, "Die NTF beginnt ihren Angriff auf das Subraumportal! Alle Schiffe zurück zum Stützpunkt!"

1260, "Endspiel"

1261, "Das 64. muss einen Rebellenangriff am Knossos-Subraumportal abfangen."

1262, "Die $h NTF hat unsere Kriegsschiffe angegriffen, die das Knossos-Portal blockieren. Wir konnten ihren ersten Angriff zurückschlagen, aber die $h NTC $h Alexandria ist zum Portal durchgebrochen und in den Nebel gesprungen. Wir vermuten, dass sich die Rebellen jetzt sammeln und neu formieren für einen zweiten Angriff. Das Oberkommando hat die $f GTA $f Monitor abkommandiert, um den Angriff abzuwehren, und weitere Verstärkungen sind unterwegs."

1263, "Das 64. wird bei diesem Einsatz als Jagdgeschwader eingesetzt. Die $h NTF hat noch ein paar Staffeln Zeus und Medusas übrig, daher wird Ihr Einsatzziel die Vernichtung aller Bomber und ihres Jagdschutzes sein. Die $f Colossus greift die $h NTC $h Vanguard und die $h NTCv $h Congreve an. Wir werden die $f Colossus in Position bringen, sobald dieses Gefecht hier entschieden ist."

1264, "Halten Sie die Augen nach der NTF Iceni auf. Sollte dieses Schiff in Ihrer Reichweite auftauchen, haben Sie die Erlaubnis, es anzugreifen und zu vernichten. Bosch spielt mit unseren Truppen Katz und Maus, seit er in das Gamma-Draconis-System gekommen ist. Wir nehmen an, er will das Knossosgerät entweder unter seine Kontrolle bringen oder selbst durch das Portal springen, aber seien Sie auf alle möglichen Eventualitäten vorbereitet."

1265, "Das ist das Endspiel, Pilot. Boschs $h Neo-Terranische $h Front ist zerschmettert. Nur die letzten Fanatiker sind noch übrig. Sie werden bis zum Tode kämpfen und versuchen, so viele von uns mitzunehmen wie möglich. Wir haben vollstes Vertrauen in Ihre Fähigkeiten, diese Aufgabe zu erledigen. Viel Glück."

1266, "Der Aquitaine steht jetzt die GTM-4a Tornado zur Verfügung, eine Weiterentwicklung der Hornet-Rakete. Dank ihres verbesserten Feuerleitsystems und leistungsfähigerer Steuerungscomputer kann die Tornado öfter und präziser feuern als die Hornet. Achten Sie aber darauf, dass Sie das Ziel richtig aufschalten, sonst schiesst die Lafette nicht korrekt."

1267, "Ausserdem dürfen Sie die neue GTM-11 Infyrno einsetzen, eine flächendeckende Jägerabwehr-Splitterrakete. Die Infyrno wird durch Fernsteuerung gezündet. Drücken Sie Ihren Feuerknopf für die Sekundärwaffen ein zweites Mal, um die Sprengköpfe zu zünden. Eine Anzeige im HUD meldet Ihnen die Entfernung von der Rakete. Die Infyrno zersplittert in mehrere Kleinstsprengköpfe mit extrem explosiven Ladungen."

1268, "Die Allianz hat den 64. Raptors den Auftrag erteilt, die Monitor, die Fortune und die vielen tausend Menschen an Bord dieser Schiffe zu beschützen. Wir aber haben versagt und diesen Auftrag nicht erfüllt. Obwohl diese Offiziere und Mannschaften ihr Leben für die GTVA geopfert haben, gibt es für uns keinen Heldenempfang. Unser Job wäre es gewesen, diese Männer und Frauen lebendig und gesund heim zu bringen. 

Ich empfehle Ihre sofortige Versetzung aus dieser Einheit. Der Admiral und ich glauben, dass Sie wohl besser geeignet sind, ein Versorgungsschiff, einen Frachter oder vielleicht einen Transporter zu fliegen. Ein taktisches Geschwader jedenfalls ist der falsche Ort für einen Piloten, der seine Aufgaben nicht erfüllen kann. Hier steht zuviel auf dem Spiel."

1269, "Ihre grösste Aufmerksamkeit sollten Sie auf Bomber richten."

1270, "Die Allianz trauert um die GTC Monitor. Tausende von mutigen Offizieren und Mannschaften haben ihr Leben für die GTVA geopfert. Wir als Geschwader müssen uns fragen, ob und wie man diese Tragödie hätte verhindern können.

 Aken Bosch konnte sich seiner Gefangennahme erneut entziehen. Sein Subraumsprung so nahe beim Knossos-Gerät war ein grosses Risiko, doch dadurch konnte er in das Nebelgebiet entkommen. Rebellensaboteure an Bord der Colossus hatten für kurze Zeit die Feuerleitstelle ausser Gefecht gesetzt, um der Iceni damit eine Gelegenheit zur Flucht zu verschaffen. Diese Saboteure wurden inzwischen in Gewahrsam genommen. 

Sie hingegen werden versetzt. Admiral Petrarch hat uns gebeten, ihm Piloten für ein Offiziers-Austauschprogramm mit den Vasudanern zu empfehlen. Der Admiral und ich glauben, dass eine Dienstperiode beim Vasudanischen Taktischen Befehlsstab Ihnen gut tun könnte."

1271, "Die Allianz trauert um die GTC Fortune. Tausende von mutigen Offizieren und Mannschaften haben ihr Leben für die GTVA geopfert. Wir als Geschwader müssen uns fragen, ob und wie man diese Tragödie hätte verhindern können.

Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat und die Vollversammlung danken Ihnen für Ihre Dienste bei Deneb, Epsilon Pegasi und Gamma Draconis. Aken Bosch konnte sich seiner Gefangennahme erneut entziehen.

1279, "Command, die Rebellen ziehen sich zurück!"

1280, "Colossus hier. Bleiben Sie dicht bei uns, Piloten. Wir werden uns um diese Kerle kümmern."

1281, "Hier spricht die Monitor. Wir werden hier draussen zu Klump geschossen! Setzen Sie sofort die Colossus ein, Command!"

1282, "Die Colossus wird jeden Moment in Position sein. Durchhalten!"

1283, "Wir verlieren die Monitor! Wir brauchen mehr Jagdschutz für die Korvette!"

1284, "Die Monitor ist zerstört worden!"

1285, "Hier GTC Fortune. Wir können keinen direkten Treffer mehr wegstecken! Erbitten sofortige Hilfe!"

1286, "Durchhalten, Fortune. Hilfe ist unterwegs!"

1287, "Die Rebellen haben die Fortune vernichtet!"

1288, "Die NTC Loyola ist Geschichte! Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten!"

1289, "Zielobjekt Danton ausgeschaltet!"

1290, "Willkommen, Alpha-Staffel. Alles ruhig an der Knossos-Front. Wir haben die erste Welle der NTF zurückgeschlagen, aber sie werden zurückkommen. Wir haben gerade gehört, dass die Colossus die NTC Vanguard abgeschossen hat."

1291, "Wir geben Ihnen Feuerschutz, Monitor. Diese Bomber kommen nicht mal auf zwei Kilometer an Sie ran."

1292, "Fangen Sie die Staffel Aquarius ab! Schalten sie die Raketen aus, bevor sie die Monitor treffen!"

1293, "Hier spricht die GTVA Colossus. Monitor, Sie sind abgelöst. Gute Arbeit, Captain."

1294, "In Ordnung, Colossus. Wir verziehen uns."

1295, "Und achten Sie auf den Jäger-Geleitschutz! Lassen Sie sich nicht von den Kerlen in die Zange nehmen!"

1296, "Ein Kreuzer der Aeolus-Klasse ist gerade angekommen! Es ist die NTC Loyola! Die Rebellen haben mit ihrem Angriff begonnen!"

1297, "Die haben eine Staffel Lokis als Geleitschutz dabei, Zielbezeichnung Sagittarius!"

1298, "Die Danton ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht! Angriff nach eigenem Ermessen. In Polaris haben wir 40 Piloten beim Kampf gegen die Danton verloren."

1299, "Also, wo steckt die Iceni? Lassen Sie uns das hier zu Ende bringen."

1300, "Command! Wir haben einen Totalausfall der Feuerleitsteuerung! Wir brauchen 30 Sekunden, um die Hilfssysteme zu aktivieren!"

1301, "Soviel Zeit haben wir nicht, Colossus!"

1302, "Die Iceni hat das Knossos-Portal erreicht! Sie springt in den Nebel!"

1303, "Negativ. Wir schicken einen Suchtrupp, um den Admiral zu finden."

1304, "Command, sollen wir die Iceni durch das Portal verfolgen?"

1305, "Die Neo-Terranische Front ist zerschlagen, Piloten. Die Rebellion ist vorbei. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1306, "Der Nebel des Krieges"

1307, "Das 203. Geschwader der GVD Psamtik greift eine shivanische Minenoperation im Nebelgebiet an."

1308, "Dämmerung

Hier spricht Admiral Khafre, Kommandant der GVD Psamtik, 13. Vasudanischer Kampfverband. Die Rebellion der NTF ist beendet. Polaris, Regulus und Sirius stehen jetzt unter der Kontrolle der Allianz, und nach 18 Monaten des Blutvergiessens können wir endlich wieder damit anfangen, diese Systeme aufzubauen. NTF-Offiziere, die für Völkermord an vasudanischen Zivilisten verantwortlich sind, werden auf Beta Aquilae vor ein Kriegsverbrechertribunal gestellt. Die GTVA-Kriegsschiffe im Nebelgebiet jagen jetzt die Iceni und die anderen Blockadebrecher."

1309, "Willkommen, Terraner!
Ich möchte die terranischen Piloten, die in Gamma Draconis zu uns gekommen sind, an Bord herzlich willkommen heissen. Ihre Teilnahme am Offiziers-Austauschprogramm wird zur Verbesserung und Festigung der gegenseitigen Beziehungen und unserer Kooperation beitragen. Sie werden in vasudanischen Staffeln Ihren Dienst versehen und vasudanische Jäger fliegen. Unsere Wartungstrupps haben die Maschinen an die Bedürfnisse terranischer Piloten angepasst. Unser Bündnis hat sich seit dem terranisch-vasudanischen Krieg weit entwickelt, und Initiativen wie diese können das Band zwischen unseren Rassen nur stärken."

1310, "Die Zweite Front

Nachdem die Rebellion niedergeschlagen ist, können wir uns jetzt auf unsere Operation im Nebelgebiet konzentrieren. 

Wir haben dort drei wichtige Ziele: eventuelle unerforschte shivanische Sprungknoten zu finden, alle gegnerischen Schiffe zu vernichten und Admiral Aken Bosch gefangenzunehmen. 

Wir starten unsere Geschwader um 32.30 Vasudanische Galaxiszeit."

1311, "Das Maxim

Die Psamtik hat eine Ladung neue Waffen bekommen, darunter die neuen GTW-66 Maxim-Geschütze. Das Maxim ist rein technisch gesehen eine Energiewaffe, obwohl es sich wie ein Massenbeschleuniger benimmt und hülsenlose Urangeschosse aus seinem glattgezogenen Lauf verschiesst. Das Maxim kann nur mit Mühe Schilde durchdringen, aber seine Wirkung auf Rumpfpanzerung ist vernichtend.

Setzen Sie dieses Geschütz nach Bedarf ein."

1312, "Die Lamprey

Ausserdem wird Ihnen die GTW-83 Lamprey-Kanone zugeteilt, eine Kurzschlusswaffe der zweiten Generation. Die Lamprey wirkt auf die Energiesysteme Ihres Zieles und schliesst Waffen-, Schild- und Nachbrennerenergie kurz. Zusammen mit einer ausgewogenen Waffe gegen Panzerung und Schilde ist die Lamprey sehr wirksam gegen kleinere Schiffe."

1313, "Das Mekhu HL-7

Achtung, Terraner: Vasudanische Jäger und Bomber sind eventuell mit dem Mekhu HL-7 ausgestattet, einer modifizierten Version des Subach HL-7. Das Design des Mekhu wurde an die Reaktorkennlinien vasudanischer Schiffe angepasst, um die Feuergeschwindigkeit zu erhöhen."

1314, "Willkommen bei der 203., Terraner. Ich bin Commander Habu, Ihr Geschwaderführer. Unsere Einheit dient dem Imperator seit dem Krieg zwischen unseren Rassen vor fast fünf Jahrzehnten. Ich habe gehört, Sie waren einer von den Piloten, die uns im Deneb-System unterstützt haben. Wir fühlen uns geehrt, an Ihrer Seite zu kämpfen, Pilot. Sie werden die Staffel Alpha führen."

1315, "Das alliierte Oberkommando hat dem 203. den Auftrag erteilt, den gegnerischen Gasabbau in der Nähe unserer Aussengrenze zu stören. Aufklärer haben sechs Gasminenschiffe der Rahu-Klasse geortet, die im Schutz einer Kette von Sperrgeschützen operieren. Ihr vorrangiges Ziel ist die Zerstörung der Miner, Ihr Sekundärziel die Ausschaltung der Sperrgeschütze."

1316, "Beachten Sie, dass die Schockwelle bei der Explosion eines Gas-Miners einen grösseren Zerstörungsradius hat als die eines anderen Schiffes vergleichbarer Grösse. Wenn Ihr Schiff im Gefecht ohnehin schon Schaden genommen hat, halten Sie so viel Abstand wie möglich von dem Minenschiff. Wir glauben, dass die Shivaner das Nebelgas als Energiequelle benutzen. Viel Glück."

1317, "Der alliierte Geheimdienst hat keine verlässlichen Daten über die Sathanas, das shivanische Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse, das die Tatenen zerstört hat. Der Sicherheitsrat der GTVA hat den Notstand ausgerufen. 

Wenn unsere vorläufigen Analysen zutreffen, bereiten die Shivaner eine grossangelegte Invasion vor. Und die Sathanas könnte eine viel grössere Bedrohung darstellen als der Superzerstörer Lucifer im Grossen Krieg. Unser Hauptziel ist es daher, so viele Daten wie möglich zu sammeln. In der Zwischenzeit bereitet das Oberkommando einen Notfallplan vor, falls die Shivaner dieses Schiff nach Gamma Draconis verlegen. 

Sie haben sich gut geschlagen bei diesem Einsatz. Wir haben ihren Gasabbau empfindlich gestört, aber jetzt haben wir grössere Ziele, um die wir uns kümmern müssen."

1318, "Kein Vasudaner verlässt jemals das Schlachtfeld ohne Erlaubnis eines Vorgesetzten. Ihre Feigheit hat das Leben unserer Brüder und Schwestern in Gefahr gebracht. Daher werden Ihnen hiermit neben Ihrer Flugerlaubnis auch alle Rechte und Privilegien eines Offiziers der Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Allianz aberkannt. Sie werden in Gewahrsam genommen und der Führung des 3. Terranischen Kampfverbandes übergeben, um dort vor ein Kriegsgericht gestellt zu werden. Sie sind eine Schande für Ihre Rasse, Terraner."

1319, "Der alliierte Geheimdienst hat keine verlässlichen Daten über die Sathanas, das shivanische Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse, das die Tatenen zerstört hat. Der Sicherheitsrat der GTVA hat den Notstand ausgerufen.

In der Zwischenzeit bereitet das Oberkommando einen Notfallplan vor, falls die Shivaner dieses Schiff nach Gamma Draconis verlegen. 

Ihre Tapferkeit und Ihr Können sind aussergewöhnlich, Terraner. Ihre Vorgesetzten haben Sie in den höchsten Tönen gelobt, und wir sehen jetzt, dass sie nicht übertrieben haben. Sie haben Ihr Leben aufs Spiel gesetzt, um Ihre Ziele zu erreichen, weit mehr, als es die reine Pflichterfüllung gefordert hätte, und ohne Ansehen der Gefahr. Wir machen aus Ihnen noch einen echten Vasudaner."

1325, "An alle Einheiten: Zurück zum Stützpunkt! Wir haben nicht genug Feuerkraft, um uns mit diesem Kriegsschiff anzulegen!"

1326, "Achtung, alle Einheiten. Tiefraumscanner haben als Grenzsicherung sechs Sperrgeschütze und eine Staffel Jäger der Mara-Klasse geortet, Zielbezeichnung Virgo. Seien Sie vorsichtig."

1327, "Zwei Sperrgeschütze erledigt."

1328, "Nur noch zwei Sperrgeschütze übrig."

1329, "Zwei Miner erledigt! Wiederhole: Zwei Miner sind erledigt!"

1330, "Nur noch zwei Rahu-Miner übrig. Erledigen Sie sie, Alpha!"

1331, "Fünfter Miner vernichtet."

1332, "Die Tatenen ist zerstört worden! Ich wiederhole! Die Tatenen ist zerstört worden!"

1333, "Hier spricht die Tatenen. Shivanische Bomber greifen uns an! Erbitten sofortigen Jagdschutz!"

1334, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot. Das hat den Gegner schon fünfzig Prozent seiner Ressourcen gekostet. Führen Sie den Einsatz zu Ende."

1335, "Die GVA Junit liefert Ihnen AWACS-Unterstützung."

1336, "Ein Sperrgeschütz der Belial-Klasse ausgeschaltet. Fünf weitere sind noch aktiv."

1337, "Wir haben drei der sechs Geschütze ausgeschaltet."

1338, "Ziele an der Grenzbefestigung ausgeschaltet. Alle Geschütze erledigt."

1339, "Wir haben einen der Miner erwischt. Fünf sind noch übrig. Suchen und vernichten.."

1340, "Vom Gegner lösen, Tatenen! Abdrehen und zurückziehen, wir holen Sie da raus."

1341, "An alle Einheiten: Verteidigen Sie die Tatenen! Wir nehmen den Angriff später wieder auf, sobald diese Bedrohung ausgeschaltet ist. Abfangen und vernichten!"

1342, "An alle Einheiten: Wir empfangen eine ungewöhnliche Sprungsignatur in Ihrer Nähe. Suchen und identifizieren."

1343, "Monster im Nebel"

1344, "Mit Hilfe der Ptah-Tarnkappenjäger soll Alpha 1 die Subsysteme der Sathanas scannen."

1345, "Alpha 1, Sie übernehmen den neuen Tarnkappenjäger der Ptah-Klasse. Ihr Auftrag lautet, die Subsysteme der Sathanas zu scannen. Der alliierte Geheimdienst braucht Daten über Navigation, Waffen, Sensoren und Kommunikationssysteme des Schlachtschiffs."

1346, "Um ein Subsystem zu scannen. müssen Sie es erst mit der Zielsteuerung erfassen und sich dann dem Ziel bis auf 150 Meter nähern. Die Vorhaltanzeige des Gegners muss in der Mitte Ihrer Zielvorrichtung bleiben. Halten Sie diese Position, bis sich die Scanmarkierung über Ihre Zielanzeige bewegt hat. Die durchschnittliche Scandauer beträgt etwa fünf Sekunden."

1347, "Das Design des Tarnkappenjägers minimiert Ihre elektronische Silhouette, allerdings haben wir ihn natürlich nicht an shivanischen Gegnern testen können. Fliegen Sie den gegnerischen Jägern nicht gerade direkt vor die Cockpitkanzel, und bleiben Sie ständig in Bewegung. Je länger Sie an der gleichen Stelle kleben, desto grösser die Gefahr einer Entdeckung. Sobald Sie eine Waffe abfeuern, verraten Sie natürlich auch Ihre Position."

1348, "Als Ablenkungsmanöver wird die $f GVCv $f Maahes einen direkten Angriff auf das Heck des Kriegsschiffes fliegen. Das lenkt das gegnerische Feuer von Ihnen ab, so dass Sie sich auf Ihre Ziele konzentrieren können. Die $h Sathanas hat eine kleinere Anzahl an Türmen in diesem Quadranten, aber Sie müssen Ihre Aufgabe trotzdem schnell erledigen, denn unsere Korvette kann sich nicht lange gegen ein Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse halten."

1349, "Sehr beeindruckend, Terraner. Obwohl der Vasudanische Taktische Befehlsstab seine Zweifel hatte, war der Einsatz unseres Tarnkappenjägers der Ptah-Klasse erfolgreich. Trotz widriger Umstände haben Sie die die Subsysteme des shivanischen Schlachtschiffs scannen können. 

Die Systemanalytiker der GTVN arbeiten sich gerade durch die Daten und suchen eine Schwachstelle in der Abwehr der Juggernaut-Klasse. Sobald der Geheimdienst seinen Bericht abgeschlossen hat, wird das alliierte Oberkommando einen Plan entwerfen, wie wir mit der Sathanas fertigwerden können."

1350, "Die Operation lief nicht so reibungslos ab, wie wir gehofft hatten. Trotzdem: Sie haben ein gefährliches Gefecht überlebt und zumindest drei der vier Subsysteme gescannt. Uns fehlen zwar jetzt noch 25% der benötigten Daten, doch unsere Systemanalytiker versichern uns, dass Ihre Leistung in Anbetracht der Umstände zufriedenstellend war. Vielleicht hätte ein vasudanischer Pilot mit dem ungewöhnlichen Design unseres Tarnkappenjägers weniger Probleme und bei der Mission mehr Erfolg gehabt."

1351, "Die Operation lief nicht so reibungslos ab, wie wir gehofft hatten. Nachdem wir nur die Daten von zwei der vier Subsysteme haben, fehlen unseren Systemanalytikern die nötigen Informationen, um eine erfolgversprechende Angriffstaktik zu entwickeln. Wir haben keine andere Wahl, als diese Operation noch einmal zu versuchen. 

Aber keine Bange, Sie müssen nicht noch einmal fliegen; der Vasudanische Taktische Befehlsstab hat uns seine Enttäuschung über Ihre Leistung übermittelt. Ihre Teilnahme am Offiziers-Austauschprogramm endet mit sofortiger Wirkung. Hoffen wir um der Allianz willen, dass ein vasudanischer Pilot mit dem Ptah-Jäger mehr Erfolg hat."

1352, "Die Operation war ein Fehlschlag. Nachdem wir nur die Daten von einem der vier Subsysteme haben, fehlen unseren Systemanalytikern die nötigen Informationen, um eine erfolgversprechende Angriffstaktik zu entwickeln. Wir haben keine andere Wahl, als diese Operation noch einmal zu versuchen. 

Aber keine Bange, Sie müssen nicht noch einmal fliegen; der Vasudanische Taktische Befehlsstab hat uns seine Enttäuschung über Ihre Leistung übermittelt.

1353, "Die Operation war ein katastrophaler Fehlschlag. Nachdem Sie es nicht geschafft haben, auch nur eines der vier Subsysteme zu scannen, fehlen unseren Systemanalytikern die nötigen Informationen, um eine erfolgversprechende Angriffstaktik zu entwickeln. Wir haben keine andere Wahl, als diese Operation noch einmal zu versuchen. 

Aber keine Bange, Sie müssen nicht noch einmal fliegen; der Vasudanische Taktische Befehlsstab hat uns seine Enttäuschung über Ihre Leistung übermittelt.

1354, "Die Sathanas hat die Maahes zerstört; keine Überlebenden. Wenn Sie Ihre Einsatzziele etwas früher erreicht hätten, wäre diese Tragödie vielleicht vermeidbar gewesen. Natürlich trägt auch das Oberkommando seinen Teil der Schuld. Schliesslich hat es Sie als Piloten ausgesucht."

1355, "Ihr Angriff auf die Geschütztürme der Sathanas hat uns wichtige Informationen über die relative Kampfkraft eines Schlachtschiffs der Juggernaut-Klasse geliefert. Diese Daten sind sehr wertvoll."

1356, "Für beispielhaften Mut unter Einsatz Ihres eigenen Lebens verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit die Tapferkeitsmedaille."

1364, "Erfassen Sie das Subsystem als Ziel, und nähern Sie sich auf weniger als 150 Meter."

1365, "Um ein Subsystem richtig scannen zu können, brauchen Sie eine direkte Sichtverbindung. Wenn Sie das Subsystem nicht sehen können, erscheint eine Raute im HUD."

1366, "Auch die Vorhaltemarkierung für das Subsystem muss in Ihrem Zielbereich liegen. Die durchschnittliche Scandauer liegt bei fünf Sekunden. Wird der Scanzyklus unterbrochen, müssen Sie erneut von vorne beginnen."

1367, "Die Maahes hat die Sathanas schon angegriffen. Sie müssen sich beeilen."

1368, "Hier spricht die Maahes. Wir sind schwer beschädigt durch Geschützfeuer des Schlachtschiffs. Wir können die shivanischen Einheiten nicht ewig ablenken."

1369, "Durchhalten, Maahes. Wir brauchen mehr Zeit. Alpha 1, bewegen Sie sich!"

1370, "Command, hier spricht die Maahes. Unser Rumpf hält keine Salve mehr aus. Wir müssen uns sofort zurückziehen."

1371, "Bestätigt, Maahes. Wir holen Sie da raus. Alpha 1, Sie sind jetzt auf sich alleine gestellt."

1378, "Einmal erledigt, drei noch auf der Liste."

1379, "Gute Arbeit. Sie haben fünfzig Prozent Ihres Einsatzes erledigt."

1380, "Ausgezeichnet. Nur noch ein Subsystem bleibt zu scannen."

1381, "Einsatz erfolgreich, Alpha 1."

1382, "Sie können zum Stützpunkt zurückkehren oder noch eine weitere Aufgabe erledigen."

1383, "Zerstören Sie so viele Geschütztürme, wie Sie nur können. Der Geheimdienst braucht Daten über die Bewaffnung dieses Kriegsschiffes."

1384, "Denken Sie daran, Sie können jederzeit zum Stützpunkt zurückkehren."

1385, "Die Sathanas ist fort. Zurück zum Stützpunkt, Pilot."

1386, "...und spricht in Rätseln"

1387, "Das 203. greift ein shivanisches Kriegsschiff an, um die Sathanas in eine Falle zu locken."

1388, "Ihre Erkundung der $h Sathanas hat eine Schwachstelle in der Abwehr der Juggernaut-Klasse offenbart. Doch um diese Schwachstelle auszunutzen, bedarf es der Feuerkraft unserer Grosskampfschiffe. Die $f GVD $f Psamtik, die $f GTD $f Aquitaine und die $f GVD $f Toeris liegen auf der Lauer. Ihre Aufgabe ist es jetzt, die $h Sathanas in die Falle zu locken."

1389, "In der ersten Phase werden Sie die SC Rephaim angreifen, ein Kriegsschiff der Rakshasa-Klasse. Unsere Aufklärer haben die Rephaim in der Nähe der alliierten Sicherheitszone geortet. Der Kreuzer wird von zwei Staffeln von Jägern der Mara-Klasse begleitet. Unsere Analyse der Flugbahn der Rephaim weist auf einen Patrouillenflug hin."

1390, "Ihre erste Aufgabe ist es, die Jäger auszuschalten. Das muss schnell geschehen, bevor Verstärkung eintrifft. Sobald der Geleitschutz vernichtet ist, rufen Sie die Delta-Staffel herbei. Die Bomber werden Ihnen bei der Vernichtung der $h Rephaim helfen. Falls nötig, wird Ihre Staffel die Strahlgeschütze des Kreuzers ausschalten, um den Bombern einen sicheren Zielanflug zu ermöglichen."

1391, "Wir gehen davon aus, dass der Angriff auf die Rephaim shivanische Verstärkungen auf den Plan rufen wird. Ihr Geschwader wird die feindlichen Schiffe abfangen und vernichten, bis die Sathanas selbst eintrifft. Die Sigma-Staffel wird zu Ihrer Verstärkung bereitstehen, sobald diese Bomber von ihrem momentanen Einsatz zurück sind."

1392, "Sie können jetzt die TAG B einsetzen, eine zielsuchende Rakete mit stark verbesserter Trefferquote. Die stossfeste Lagerung der Lasersensoren ermöglicht eine viel präzisere Datenübertragung vom Leitstrahl zu den Steuerdüsen. Die $f GVCv $f Sopedu gibt bei diesem Einsatz Feuerunterstützung."

1393, "Die Allianz führt simultane, koordinierte Angriffe gegen shivanische Stellungen im Nebelgebiet durch. Aus diesem Grund können wir unsere Zerstörer nicht einsetzen, solange die $h Sathanas nicht in Ihrem Einsatzgebiet auftaucht. Wenn wir die $h Sathanas nicht in die Falle locken können und sie unsere Schiffe woanders angreift, müssen wir die Aktion abbrechen."

1394, "Um 07.45 Standardzeit orteten unsere Aufklärer das Schlachtschiff Sathanas mit Kurs auf den Sprungknoten in den terranisch-vasudanischen Raumsektor. Aufgrund der unmittelbaren Bedrohung unserer Heimatwelten hat das Oberkommando den Plan, das Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse im Nebelgebiet anzugreifen, aufgeben müssen. Alle alliierten Truppen haben Order, sich sofort nach Gamma Draconis zurückzuziehen. Weitere Befehle erhalten Sie nach Ihrer Ankunft dort. Wir haben noch keine schlüssigen Daten bezüglich der Funkmeldungen, die zwischen der Iceni und der Rephaim ausgetauscht wurden."

1395, "Vernichten Sie alle shivanischen Kriegsschiffe"

1396, "Beschützen Sie die Thutmose"

1397, "<Empfange Nachricht>"

1398, "Command, wir haben Gegner auf dem Radar, können aber kein Ziel erfassen."

1399, "Können Sie irgendwas sehen?"

1400, "Negativ. Kein Sichtkontakt."

1401, "Bleiben Sie auf dem momentanen Kurs, Pilot."

1402, "Command, wir fangen hier ungewöhnliche Signale auf."

1403, "Können Sie etwas identifizieren, Alpha?"

1404, "Die Übertragung von der Rephaim kommt rein!"

1405, "Das ist unmöglich! Das ist ein fremder Kanal!"

1406, "Bestätigt. Wir empfangen eine Sendung von dem shivanischen Kriegsschiff!"

1407, "Command, ich habe die Iceni als Ziel erfasst! Das Kommandoschiff der Rebellen befindet sich jetzt auf dem Schlachtfeld."

1408, "An alle Einheiten: Angriff auf die Shivaner! Halten Sie Abstand von der Iceni! Greifen Sie das Schiff nicht an!"

1409, "Bestätigt, Command. Wir werden die Iceni nicht angreifen."

1410, "Die Iceni hat ihren Subraumantrieb aktiviert!"

1411, "Wir setzen jetzt die Thutmose ein!"

1412, "Wir haben die Rephaim zerstört! Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten."

1413, "Hier spricht die Thutmose. Wir greifen den Gegner jetzt an."

1414, "Wir werden angegriffen! Wir haben schwere Schäden erlitten! Erbitten dringend Unterstützung, Command!"

1415, "Alpha 1, geben Sie der Thutmose etwas Feuerschutz!"

1416, "Die Korvette ist zerstört worden!"

1417, "Sprungsignatur nähert sich! Kriegsschiff der Cain-Klasse! Zielbezeichnung Thaumiel."

1418, "Wir haben die Thaumiel ausgeschaltet. Gut gemacht, Piloten."

1419, "Kriegsschiff im Anflug! Eine Korvette der Moloch-Klasse, Zielbezeichnung Golab!"

1420, "Shivanische Verstärkungen können jederzeit eintreffen. Nehmen Sie jetzt lieber neue Munition auf, wenn nötig."

1421, "Nicht zu sehen von der Sathanas! Wir müssen diesen Angriff weiterführen, um das shivanische Schlachtschiff herzulocken!"

1422, "Delta-Staffel ist in Bereitschaft. Sie können diese Bomber zur Verstärkung rufen, wann immer Sie wollen, Alpha."

1423, "Sigma-Staffel hält sich in Bereitschaft. Setzen Sie diese Bomber nach Bedarf ein."

1424, "Alle Einheiten! Zurück zum Stützpunkt! Das shivanische Schlachtschiff hat Kurs auf den Gamma-Draconis-Knoten genommen!"

1425, "Alpha 1, Sie missachten einen direkten Befehl! Command zieht die Flotte nach Gamma Draconis zurück. Wenn Sie nicht sofort aus diesem System springen, müssen wir Sie zurücklassen."

1426, "Sie werden für diese Befehlsverweigerung teuer bezahlen, Pilot. Command, Ende."

1427, "Das Flammende Schwert"

1428, "Als letzten Ausweg vernichtet die GTVA das Knossos-Subraumtor in Gamma Draconis."

1429, "Sathanas

Die Sathanas, ein shivanisches Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse, ist jetzt unterwegs zu dem Sprungknoten, der in den terranisch-vasudanischen Raumsektor führt. Das Oberkommando hat allen Einheiten befohlen, sich innerhalb der nächsten drei Stunden in Gamma Draconis zu sammeln. Der grösste Teil der Flotte hat den Befehl bestätigt, aber mindestens sechs Kriegsschiffe haben den Sammelpunkt nicht erreicht. Doch wir können jetzt nicht mehr länger warten. Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat hat die sofortige Zerstörung des Knossos-Subraumportals angeordnet."

1430, "Die Mesonenbombe

Um das Knossosportal zu vernichten, werden wir eine Mesonenbombe benutzen, eine neue Experimentalwaffe, die vom Hideki-Institut im Vega-System entwickelt wurde. Ihre genauen Daten unterliegen der Geheimhaltung, doch die Wissenschaftler versichern uns, dass diese Bombe eine grössere Sprengkraft hat als jede andere Waffe in unserem Arsenal; genug, um jedes kleinere Schiff in einem Radius von drei Kilometern zu vernichten. Doch aufgrund ihrer Grösse kann die Waffe nicht taktisch eingesetzt werden."

1431, "Die Strategie der Allianz

Eine kleine Eingreiftruppe wird sich um die Vernichtung des Knossosgerätes kümmern, während der Grossteil der alliierten Flotte den Sprungknoten blockiert, der in das dichtbesiedelte Capella-System führt. Das Oberkommando hat damit begonnen, die 250 Millionen Bewohner von Capella zu evakuieren, der gewaltigste Exodus seit dem Grossen Krieg. Die Colossus wird in diesem System bleiben, um die Sathanas zu stellen, falls wir versagen sollten."

1432, "Um 22.30 Standardzeit hat die $f GTVA ihren Plan zur Zerstörung des Knossos-Gerätes bekanntgegeben. Aus strategischen und wissenschaftlichen Gründen werden wir das Portal nicht mit den Geschützen unserer Grosskampfschiffe unter Feuer nehmen. Die Zerstörung des Subraumportals wird mit Hilfe einer experimentellen Mesonenbombe durchgeführt."

1433, "Unser erstes Einsatzziel ist es, das Gebiet von Feinden zu säubern. Unsere Beobachter melden, dass bereits shivanische Erkundungsstaffeln nach Gamma Draconis eingedrungen sind, und die gegnerische Aktivität wird mit Sicherheit noch zunehmen, bevor das Schlachtschiff Sathanas ankommt. Die Renenet, eine Korvette der Sobek-Klasse, wird die Operation überwachen und Feuerunterstützung leisten."

1434, "Sobald wir den Gegner ausgeschaltet haben, wird ein Frachter den Mesonensprengkopf zur Explosionsstelle befördern. Das ist der erste Einsatz dieses Waffen-Prototyps. Da unsere Computersimulationen nur eine vierzigprozentige Erfolgschance ergeben haben, haben wir noch zwei weitere Sprengköpfe in Reserve."

1435, "Wir haben das Portal zerstört, doch es war umsonst. Der vom Knossosgerät erzeugte Subraumwirbel hat sich schon stabilisiert, und die Sathanas ist ins Gamma-Draconis-System gelangt. Unsere Flotte steht bereit, um das Schlachtschiff am Capella-Sprungknoten abzufangen. Wir wissen nicht, wie lange der Nebel-Sprungknoten offen bleibt. Theoretisch könnte es Jahrhunderte dauern, bevor er wieder kollabiert. Unsere Wissenschaftler sind sich sicher, dass wir genug Daten gesammelt haben, um das Knossosgerät nachbauen zu können, aber ein Projekt dieser Grössenordnung würde Jahrzehnte in Anspruch nehmen."

1436, "Wir bedauern den Verlust der GVCv Renenet, ihrer Mannschaft und der Wissenschaftler an Bord. Unter den gegebenen Umständen hätten Sie nichts tun können, um diese Katastrophe zu verhindern."

1437, "Trotzdem ist Ihre Hartnäckigkeit bewundernswert. Sie haben alle shivanischen Jäger vernichtet. Sie machen Ihrer Rasse alle Ehre. Der Vasudanische Taktische Befehlsstab hat Ihre Leistung wohlwollend zur Kenntnis genommen."

1438, "Die Zerstörung des Frachters hätte einfach nicht passieren dürfen. Sie haben genügend Kampferfahrung, um zu wissen, dass Frachter und Transporter verwundbare Ziele darstellen und in feindlicher Umgebung besonders aufmerksamen Jagdschutz benötigen. Bei einer solchen Operation wie dieser, wo Millionen von Menschenleben auf dem Spiel stehen, können wir uns einfach keine Fehler leisten. Ein besseres Verständnis der Gefechtssituation hätte es Ihnen ermöglicht, ein erfreulicheres Resultat zu erzielen."

1439, "Es genügt nicht, beliebige zufällige Ziele anzugreifen. Sie müssen diejenigen Gegner herausfinden, die Ihr Einsatzziel bedrohen, und sich um sie kümmern, entweder durch direktes Eingreifen oder durch entsprechende Befehle an Ihre Staffelpiloten."

1440, "Wir bedauern den Verlust der GVCv Renenet, ihrer Mannschaft und der Wissenschaftler an Bord. Bei einer solchen Operation wie dieser, wo Millionen von Menschenleben auf dem Spiel stehen, können wir uns einfach keine Fehler leisten. Ein besseres Verständnis der Gefechtssituation hätte es Ihnen ermöglicht, ein erfreulicheres Resultat zu erzielen."

1441, "Greifen Sie die Gegner an"

1442, "Shivaner zur Renenet locken"

1443, "Überwachen Sie die Zerstörung des Knossosgerätes."

1444, "Vernichten Sie alle gegnerischen Ziele."

1445, "Halten Sie die Shivaner von der Mesonenbombe fern"

1446, "Halten Sie die Shivaner von der zweiten Mesonenbombe fern"

1447, "Beschützen Sie die Renenet"

1448, "Command, hier spricht die Renenet. Wir haben 2 Staffeln Mara-Jäger etwa 4000 Meter von unserer jetzigen Position geortet. Der Gegner hat uns noch nicht angegriffen."

1449, "Wir können nicht warten. Alpha, greifen Sie an und locken Sie die Jäger vom Knossosportal weg, möglichst zur Renenet hinüber. Wir müssen das Sprenggebiet freiräumen, bevor wir die Frachter losschicken."

1450, "Bestätigt. Wir werden sie in Reichweite der Geschütze der Korvette locken."

1451, "Command, wir haben den Gegner angegriffen. Wir sind jetzt auf dem Rückflug zur Renenet."

1452, "Command, wir haben eine planmässige Detonation des Mesonensprengkopfs erreicht, aber das Knossosportal ist weiterhin voll einsatzbereit."

1453, "Wir fahren mit dem zweiten Einsatz fort. Zerstörungsmuster Sigma. Wir werden alle verbleibenden Mesonenbomben für diesen Versuch einsetzen. Die Sathanas kann nicht weit weg sein."

1454, "Die Mesonenbomben haben die Aufmerksamkeit der Shivaner erweckt. Verteidigen Sie die Sprengköpfe, bis sie in Position sind und die Frachter das Gebiet wieder verlassen haben."

1455, "Hier spricht Lambda 2. Wir sind jetzt in Position."

1456, "Lambda 3 hier. Wir haben die Einsatzstelle erreicht."

1457, "Command, wir haben das Päckchen abgegeben und verziehen uns jetzt wieder."

1458, "Abdocksequenz abgeschlossen. Wir kehren jetzt zum Stützpunkt zurück."

1459, "Lambda 2 ist fort."

1460, "Lambda 2 vernichtet! Wiederhole! Lambda 2 vernichtet! An alle Einheiten: Zurück zum Stützpunkt. Wir müssen diese Einsatz abbrechen."

1461, "Wir haben Lambda 2 verloren. Machen Sie weiter mit Ihrem Auftrag."

1462, "Lambda 3 hat den Sprung in den Subraum geschafft."

1463, "An alle Einheiten: Zurück zum Stützpunkt! Wir haben den Mesonensprengkopf verloren! Sofort Sprungantrieb aktivieren!"

1464, "Lambda 3 ist zerstört worden."

1465, "Command, hier spricht Lambda 1. Wir sind jetzt in Position. Beginnen mit der Abdocksequenz."

1466, "Mesonensprengkopf scharfgemacht und bereit, Command. Wir verschwinden hier."

1467, "Lambda 1 hat die Gefahrenzone verlassen."

1468, "Wir haben den Sprengkopf verloren! Wir ziehen uns zurück, Alpha. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1469, "Lambda 1 wurde vernichtet."

1470, "Command, wir haben die Gegend grundgereinigt. Alle Gegner wurden ausgeschaltet."

1471, "Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass ein einzelner Gefechtskopf stark genug ist, um ein Bauwerk dieser Grösse zu beschädigen."

1472, "Besonders eine Waffe von terranischem Design."

1473, "Die Mesonenbombe ist eine Gemeinschaftsentwicklung, Alpha 4. Wir sind gleichberechtigte Partner bei diesem Unternehmen."

1474, "Alpha-Staffel, Sie wären gut beraten, sich um die Shivaner zu kümmern und diese Sachen dem Sicherheitsrat zu überlassen."

1475, "Die Shivaner haben Ihre Herausforderung angenommen, Alpha-Staffel. Fliegen Sie zurück zur Renenet. Unsere Geschütztürme werden das Feuer eröffnen, sobald der Gegner in Reichweite kommt."

1476, "Beginne Sprengsequenz. An alle Einheiten: Abstand zur Sprengzone halten."

1477, "Alpha, Sie müssen mindestens 3.000 Meter von der Mitte des Portals entfernt sein."

1478, "Alpha, dies ist Ihre letzte Warnung. Wir haben keine andere Wahl als zu sprengen."

1479, "Detonation in . . 5 . . 4 . . 3 . . 2 . . 1 . . Null"

1480, "Gegner im Anflug! Zwölf Jäger der Dragon-Klasse sind in Gamma Draconis aufgetaucht!"

1481, "An alle Einheiten: Vorbereiten auf zweite Detonation. Sie müssen 3.000 Meter von den Sprengköpfen entfernt sein. Dies ist Ihre letzte Warnung."

1482, "Command, Zerstörungsmuster Sigma war erfolgreich. Das Knossos-Subraumportal ist zerstört worden."

1483, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Renenet. Sie haben da draussen gerade Millionen von Menschen das Leben gerettet. Wir werden Sie bei Ihrer Rückkehr zur Flotte als Helden feiern!"

1484, "Bei allem nötigen Respekt, Command, da gibt es wohl kaum Grund zum Feiern. Die Zerstörung dieses uralten Artefaktes ist ein unschätzbarer Verlust!"

1485, "Unsere Wissenschaftler haben alle Daten, die wir brauchen, um das Portal später einmal neu zu bauen, Renenet. Wir haben gerade die zweite shivanische Invasion unseres Heimatsystems verhindert."

1486, "Command, ich orte eine Sprungsignatur; sie nähert sich! Die Sathanas ist im Anflug auf das System!"

1487, "Das ist unmöglich! Erbitten sofortigen Statusbericht!"

1488, "Der Sprungknoten zwischen Gamma Draconis und dem Nebel ist stabil. Unsere Zerstörung des Knossosportals hatte keine Auswirkungen."

1489, "An alle Einheiten: Zurück zum Stützpunkt! Wir ziehen uns zurück! Raus da, Piloten!"

1490, "Hier Lambda 1. Wir sind auf dem Gefechtsfeld."

1491, "Hier spricht Lambda 2. Wir sind da, Command. Setzen Kurs auf die Einsatzkoordinaten."

1492, "Hier spricht Lambda 3. Fliegen weiter zum Absetzpunkt."

1493, "Keine Chance mehr auf einen Erfolg der Aktion. Zurück zum Stützpunkt, Pilot. Einsatz abgebrochen."

1494, "Bärenköder"

1495, "Die Alpha-Staffel des 203. Geschwaders muss die vorderen Geschütztürme der Sathanas ausschalten, bevor sie den Capella-Sprungknoten in Gamma Draconis erreicht."

1496, "Die $h Sathanas hat unsere Flotte am Capella-Knoten dezimiert. Ihre Bomber-Staffel wird sich die vorderen Geschütztürme des Schlachtschiffs vornehmen, bevor es Capella erreicht. Sie müssen mindestens zwei der Türme ausschalten, damit die $f Colossus eine echte Chance hat. Sie werden dazu mit den neuen Trebuchet-Langstreckenraketen und mit Helios-Torpedos ausgerüstet, den mächtigsten taktischen Sprengköpfen der $f GTVA."

1497, "Ihre Staffel hat alle vorderen Strahlgeschütze des Juggernaut-Schlachtschiffes ausgeschaltet. Die taktische Bedeutung dieser Leistung kann gar nicht hoch genug bewertet werden. Die ersten Berichte von Capella sind sehr positiv, obwohl die Schlacht noch längst nicht vorbei ist. Sie werden sofort wieder losfliegen, um die Colossus zu unterstützen."

1498, "Das war eine hervorragende Leistung."

1499, "Ihre Staffel hat drei der vorderen Strahlgeschütze des Juggernaut-Schlachtschiffes ausgeschaltet. Unter den gegebenen Umständen ist dies eine sehr gute Leistung. Die ersten Berichte von Capella sind sehr positiv, obwohl die Schlacht noch längst nicht vorbei ist. Sie werden sofort wieder losfliegen, um die Colossus zu unterstützen."

1500, "Das war eine ausgezeichnete Leistung."

1501, "Ihre Staffel hat zwei der vorderen Strahlgeschütze des Juggernaut-Schlachtschiffes ausgeschaltet. Unter den gegebenen Umständen ist diese Leistung durchaus angemessen. Die ersten Berichte von Capella sind sehr positiv, obwohl die Schlacht noch längst nicht vorbei ist. Sie werden sofort wieder losfliegen, um die Colossus zu unterstützen."

1502, "Sie haben sich gut geschlagen. Am besten setzen Sie die Helios als Sturzflugbombe ein: Da sie selbst sehr langsam ist, sollten Sie beim Ausklinken mit Höchstgeschwindigkeit fliegen."

1503, "Ihre Staffel hat nur eines der vorderen Strahlgeschütze des Juggernaut-Schlachtschiffes ausgeschaltet, Pilot. Sicher, Sie mussten gegen eine Übermacht antreten, aber keine unüberwindliche. Die Sathanas ist eine tödliche Bedrohung, nicht nur für die Colossus, sondern für alle Sonnensysteme der GTVA. Wir stehen an der Schwelle einer zweiten shivanischen Invasion, und wir haben nur sehr begrenzte Kräfte, um diesen Krieg zu führen."

1504, "Am besten setzen Sie die Helios als Sturzflugbombe ein: Da sie selbst sehr langsam ist, sollten Sie beim Ausklinken mit Höchstgeschwindigkeit fliegen."

1505, "Ihre Staffel hat nicht mal eines der Strahlgeschütze des Juggernaut-Schlachtschiffes ausgeschaltet, Pilot. Sicher, Sie mussten gegen eine Übermacht antreten, aber keine unüberwindliche. Die Sathanas ist eine tödliche Bedrohung, nicht nur für die Colossus, sondern für alle Sonnensysteme der GTVA. Wir stehen an der Schwelle einer zweiten shivanischen Invasion, und wir haben nur sehr begrenzte Kräfte, um diesen Krieg zu führen."

1506, "Sie haben ausserdem geholfen, die Beleth auszuschalten. Daher sind unsere verbleibenden Kräfte nun in der Lage, das System zu sichern."

1507, "Der Zerstörer Thebes hat das Gefecht leider nicht überstanden. Damit verlangt uns diese Schlacht ein gewaltiges Opfer ab."

1508, "Leider konnten Sie die Beleth nicht aufhalten. Aber die Vernichtung der Sathanas hat entschieden höhere Priorität."

1509, "Wenn Sie den Antrieb der Beleth lahmlegen, kann sie das System nicht verlassen."

1510, "Zerstören Sie die Geschütztürme"

1511, "Vordere Flakgeschütze zerstören"

1512, "Zerstören Sie die Geschütztürme"

1513, "Schalten Sie das vordere Strahlgeschütz Nr. 1 der Sathanas aus"

1514, "Schalten Sie das vordere Strahlgeschütz Nr. 2 der Sathanas aus"

1515, "Schalten Sie das vordere Strahlgeschütz Nr. 3 der Sathanas aus"

1516, "Schalten Sie das vordere Strahlgeschütz Nr. 4 der Sathanas aus"

1517, "Zerstören Sie die hintere Strahlkanone der Sathanas"

1518, "Zerstören Sie die vorderen Flakbatterien der Sathanas"

1519, "Zerstören Sie den primären Geschützturm der Beleth"

1520, "Zerstören Sie den primären Geschützturm Nr. 2 der Beleth"

1521, "Zerstören Sie die Beleth"

1522, "Hier spricht die Phoenicia. Unsere Aussenhülle ist über eine Länge von zwölf Decks aufgerissen. Ein Viertel unserer Mannschaft ist tot. Erlaubnis oder nicht, wir verschwinden hier, Command!"

1523, "Gut gemacht, einer weg, macht noch drei. Weiter so, Pilot, und immer in Bewegung bleiben."

1524, "Sie haben die Hälfte geschafft, Alpha. Nicht nachlassen!"

1525, "Nur noch ein Geschützturm übrig!"

1526, "Ausgezeichnet. Setzen Sie Ihren Angriff fort, Pilot. Je mehr Geschütztürme wir ausschalten, desto besser sind unsere Chancen. Aber Ihre eigentliche Arbeit ist erledigt, also gehen Sie kein unnötiges Risiko ein."

1527, "Sehr beeindruckend, Alpha 1. Die Chancen für die Colossus stehen jetzt entschieden besser."

1528, "Wir haben die Phoenicia verloren! Wiederhole! Wir haben die Phoenicia verloren!"

1529, "Die Shivaner haben die Delta-Staffel vernichtet! Jetzt hängt alles von Ihnen ab, Alpha."

1530, "Command, ich werde das Leben meiner Mannschaft nicht leichtfertig opfern. Entweder Sie setzen mehr Schiffe ein, oder wir ziehen uns zurück. Wir können diese Position nicht ohne weitere Verstärkung durch die Flotte halten!"

1531, "Alpha-Staffel, Ihr Auftrag lautet, der Phoenicia zu helfen. Wir müssen diesen Knoten trotz des shivanischen Vormarsches halten. Ihr Einsatzziel..."

1532, "Alpha, Ihr Einsatzziel ist die Zerstörung der vorderen Strahlkanonen des Schlachtschiffs. Zielen Sie auf die Spitzen der vier Arme der Sathanas."

1533, "Sie müssen der Phoenicia den Rückzug befehlen, Command. Der Zerstörer würde diesen Kampf nicht überstehen."

1534, "Und die Colossus auch nicht, wenn Sie scheitern! Sie haben Ihre Befehle. Führen Sie sie aus - sofort."

1535, "Delta-Staffel, schalten Sie die vorderen Flakgeschütze aus, oder wir werden hier in Fetzen geschossen. Alpha, konzentrieren Sie sich auf die Hauptgeschütze."

1536, "Bestätigt. Zielen auf die Flakgeschütze."

1537, "Gut gemacht, Alpha. Die Thebes wird jeden Moment im System ankommen und den Knoten sichern. Sie sollten schleunigst aufmunitionieren und eventuelle Feldreparaturen vornehmen, denn es sind noch mehr gegnerische Kriegsschiffe im Anflug. Gamma-Staffel wird eingesetzt."

1538, "Die Shivaner werden versuchen, ihren Brückenkopf in Gamma Draconis auszubauen. Wir müssen sie um jeden Preis aufhalten. Wir dürfen nicht versagen!"

1539, "Hier spricht die Thebes. Wir sind in einem grossen Trümmerfeld aufgetaucht, Command."

1540, "Die Alpha-Staffel hat gerade ein taktisches Gefecht geklärt, Thebes. Unsere Aufklärer melden einen Zerstörer der Demon-Klasse, Zielbezeichnung Beleth. Das Kriegsschiff wird jeden Moment hier sein."

1541, "Alpha und Gamma, Ihre Aufgabe wird es sein, die Strahlkanonen des Demon-Zerstörers auszuschalten. Die Thebes gibt Feuerunterstützung. Verstärkungen stehen bereit."

1542, "Ein Zerstörer der Demon-Klasse ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht. Command weiss Bescheid."

1543, "Dann müssen sie wissen, dass dieser Einsatz glatter Selbstmord ist."

1544, "Das war eine schwache Leistung, Pilot. Die Thebes wird jeden Moment im System ankommen und den Knoten sichern. Sie sollten schleunigst aufmunitionieren und eventuelle Feldreparaturen vornehmen, denn es sind noch mehr gegnerische Kriegsschiffe im Anflug. Gamma-Staffel wird eingesetzt."

1545, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten. Wir haben die Beleth zerstört. Sichern Sie die Umgebung, und dann zurück zum Stützpunkt. Wir brauchen Sie im Capella-System."

1546, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Piloten. Zurück zum Stützpunkt. Wir brauchen Sie im Capella-System."

1547, "Gute Arbeit."

1548, "Zurück zum Stützpunkt, Piloten. Wir brauchen Sie im Capella-System zur Unterstützung der Colossus."

1549, "Die Phoenicia wird die Sathanas aufhalten, bis Sie Ihre Ziele erreicht haben."

1550, "Wir haben die erste Strahlkanone ausgeschaltet!"

1551, "Gute Arbeit. Die Demon hat nur noch einen funktionsfähigen Strahlgeschützturm."

1552, "Wir haben das letzte Hauptgeschütz vernichtet. Ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Konzentrieren Sie sich jetzt auf das Jägerabwehrgeschütz und die Flakkanonen."

1553, "Die Sathanas aktiviert ihren Subraumantrieb. An alle Einheiten: Aus dem Weg!"

1554, "Sie haben bei diesem Einsatz versagt, Pilot. Die Sathanas wird volle Kampfstärke aufweisen, wenn sie auf die Colossus trifft."

1555, "Die Beleth ist ins Capella-System eingeflogen! Das gibt ein Massaker, Pilot! Ihre Inkompetenz hat Millionen unschuldiger Menschen gefärdet! Zurück zum Stützpunkt!"

1556, "Die vorderen Flakgeschütze sind ausgeschaltet. Gute Arbeit."

1557, "Die Beleth schaltet den Sprungantrieb ein! An alle Einheiten: Zurückbleiben!"

1558, "Die Entscheidungsschlacht"

1559, "Die Colossus und die Sathanas treffen im Capella-System aufeinander."

1560, "Die $h Sathanas ist in das Capella-System eingedrungen und hat die Abwehrlinie vernichtet, die wir errichtet hatten, um das Schlachtschiff aufzuhalten. Wir haben jetzt keine andere Wahl, als die $f Colossus loszuschicken. Doch da ihre Geschütztürme noch immer einsatzbereit sind, hat die $h Sathanas genügend Feuerkraft, um selbst diesen Kampf für sich zu entscheiden. Ihre Staffel wird sofort wieder aufsteigen; es bleibt Ihnen nicht mal genug Zeit, um sich Ihr Schiff und Ihre Bewaffnung auszusuchen. Ihr Auftrag lautet, die verbleibenden Geschütze der $h Sathanas so schnell wie möglich auszuschalten. Wenn Sie das nicht schaffen, verlieren wir schlimmstenfalls die $f Colossus und das gesamte Capella-System."

1561, "Die $h Sathanas ist in das Capella-System eingedrungen und hat die $f Colossus angegriffen. Ihre ausgezeichnete Leistung bei Gamma Draconis hat die Chancen für die Allianz erheblich verbessert. Wir setzen Ihre Staffel als Bomberunterstützung für die $f Colossus ein. Zerstören Sie alle sich bietenden Ziele, aber gehen Sie kein unnötiges Risiko ein."

1562, "Mit der Vernichtung der SJ Sathanas hat das alliierte Oberkommando einen entscheidenden Sieg errungen. In den kommenden Monaten werden wir die Überreste der shivanischen Flotte isolieren und auslöschen. Diese Operation hätte ohne Ihre Hilfe niemals Erfolg haben können, Pilot. Indem Sie die vorderen Geschütztürme der Sathanas ausgeschaltet haben, verhalfen Sie der Colossus zu dem Vorteil, den sie zum Sieg brauchte. 

ufgrund Ihrer herausragenden Leistungen verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit den Nebel-Siegesstern. Dieser Orden würdigt Ihren Beitrag zu unserem Feldzug, von der ersten Schlacht bei Gamma Draconis bis zu unserem Sieg im Capella-System. Vor allem ehren wir damit Ihre drei erfolgreichen Einsätze gegen das shivanische Juggernaut- Schlachtschiff Sathanas. Herzlichen Glückwunsch, Terraner."

1563, "Mit der Vernichtung der SJ Sathanas hat das alliierte Oberkommando einen entscheidenden Sieg errungen. In den kommenden Monaten werden wir die Überreste der shivanischen Flotte isolieren und auslöschen. Diese Operation wäre noch besser ausgegangen, wenn Sie Ihre Einsatzziele erreicht hätten. Obwohl die Colossus das Gefecht gewonnen hat, hatte eine Vernichtung der vorderen Geschütztürme der Sathanas den Schaden, den wir erlitten haben, erheblich verringert."

1564, "Die GTVA Colossus ist zerstört. Das mächtigste und stärkste terranisch-vasudanische Kriegsschiff, das es jemals gab, das zu bauen zwanzig Jahre dauerte, wurde innerhalb weniger Minuten vernichtet. Mehr als dreissigtausend Offiziere und Mannschaften fanden in dieser Schlacht den Tod, Millionen weitere Menschen sind in Gefahr. Sie haben es zwar geschafft, die vier vorderen Geschütztürme der Sathanas auszuschalten, aber Sie haben Ihr Ziel zu spät erreicht."

1565, "Die GTVA Colossus ist zerstört. Das mächtigste und stärkste terranisch-vasudanische Kriegsschiff, das es jemals gab, das zu bauen zwanzig Jahre dauerte, wurde innerhalb weniger Minuten vernichtet. Mehr als dreissigtausend Offiziere und Mannschaften fanden in dieser Schlacht den Tod, Millionen weitere Menschen sind in Gefahr. Sie haben es nicht geschafft, die vorderen Geschütztürme der Sathanas auszuschalten, Pilot, und jetzt müssen wir alle den Preis für Ihr Versagen bezahlen."

1566, "Zerstören Sie die Geschütze"

1567, "Zerstören Sie die vordere Strahlkanone Nummer 1 der Sathanas"

1568, "Zerstören Sie die vordere Strahlkanone Nummer 2 der Sathanas"

1569, "Zerstören Sie die vordere Strahlkanone Nummer 3 der Sathanas"

1570, "Zerstören Sie die vordere Strahlkanone Nummer 4 der Sathanas"

1571, "Helfen Sie der Colossus, die Sathanas auszuschalten"

1572, "Gut gemacht. Sichern Sie das Gebiet, dann ist unsere Arbeit hier erledigt."

1573, "Colossus hier. Wir haben geringe Schäden erlitten. Rumpf aufgerissen von Deck 140 bis 200. Schadenskontrolle besagt, dass mehrere Hilfssysteme ausgefallen sind."

1574, "Command, hier spricht die Colossus. Rumpfzustand verschlechtert sich rapide. Mehrere wichtige Systeme sind kurz vor dem Ausfall. Zahl der Opfer steigt schnell."

1575, "Colossus hier! Wir verkraften keine weitere Salve mehr! Wir müssen uns augenblicklich zurückziehen, Command!"

1576, "Wir haben die Colossus verloren! Einsatz abbrechen, Alpha. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1577, "Sie müssen zwei weitere Strahlkanonen ausschalten. Erfassen Sie Ihr Ziel, und greifen Sie an!"

1578, "Sie müssen nur noch eine der vorderen Strahlkanonen ausschalten. Erfassen Sie Ihr Ziel, und greifen Sie an!"

1579, "Hören Sie, Alpha. Greifen Sie an, was sich Ihnen noch an Zielen anbietet, aber seien Sie vorsichtig. Jetzt hängt alles von der Colossus ab."

1580, "Die Sathanas ist vernichtet! An alle Einheiten: Zurückziehen!"

1581, "Colossus, das Schlachtschiff hat nur mässige Schäden erlitten. Sie müssen mehr Energie auf Ihre Hauptgeschütze leiten!"

1582, "Wir haben Probleme, unsere Energieversorgung aufrechtzuerhalten, Command. Wir fahren weniger wichtige Systeme runter."

1583, "Mehr Feuerkraft, Colossus! Der Rumpfzustand der Sathanas liegt schon unter fünfzig Prozent."

1584, "Unsere Wärmetauscher sind für solche Belastungen nicht gebaut, Command! Uns schmelzen die Geschütze weg, wenn wir so weitermachen."

1585, "Wir haben es fast geschafft, Colossus! Zustand des Ziels ist im kritischen Bereich! Der Krieg muss hier und jetzt enden!"

1586, "Sekundär- und Tertiärreaktoren ausgefallen! Feuerleitkontrolle weit im roten Bereich! Wir geben alles, was drin ist!"

1587, "Nur noch eine Kanone! Die Zeit wird langsam knapp, Alpha!"

1588, "Alle Geschütze ausgeschaltet! Wiederhole: Alle Geschütze ausgeschaltet! Greifen Sie an, was sich Ihnen noch an Zielen bietet, aber seien Sie vorsichtig. Jetzt hängt alles von der Colossus ab."

1589, "Sie haben Ihren Einsatz zu spät erledigt, Pilot. Die Schlacht ist verloren. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1590, "Die Shivaner haben eine Staffel Jäger ausgesetzt, Zielbezeichnung Cancer. Lassen Sie sich von denen nicht von Ihrem Einsatzziel abhalten, Alpha."

1591, "Wir haben die Cancer-Staffel ausgeschaltet."

1592, "Zurück zur Babel"

1593, "Das 203. muss die NTF Iceni abfangen, Admiral Boschs Flaggschiff."

1594, "Der Triumph der Colossus

Um 03.45 Standardzeit vernichtete die GTVA Colossus das shivanische Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse Sathanas in der Nähe des Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknotens in Capella. Dieser Sieg beweist ohne jeden Zweifel unsere heutige technische Überlegenheit im Vergleich zu unserem Erzfeind aus den Zeiten des Grossen Krieges. Zum zweiten Mal hat die Allianz eine Rasse besiegt, die überall in der Galaxis ganze Zivilisationen ausgerottet hat. 

Mit der Colossus brauchen wir nichts mehr zu fürchten."

1595, "Schadenskontrolle

Aber wir haben noch viel zu erledigen. Die Sathanas hat einige Schäden an der Colossus angerichtet, obwohl deren Systeme noch zu rund 80% funktionstüchtig sind. Terranische und Vasudanische Ingenieure sind übereinstimmend der Meinung, dass es Monate dauern wird, alle Schäden am Rumpf dieses Schiffes zu beseitigen. Bis wir das Nebelgebiet vollständig gesichert haben, wird unsere Evakuierung der capellanischen Zivilbevölkerung wie geplant fortgesetzt."

1596, "Jagd auf die Iceni

Nachdem die unmittelbare shivanische Bedrohung ausgeschaltet ist, müssen wir uns jetzt auf die Gefangennahme von Admiral Bosch konzentrieren. Unsere Aufklärer durchkämmen des Nebel nach einer Spur seines Kommandoschiffes. Die Psamtik wird den Kampfverband anführen, der die Iceni stellen soll, sobald wir ihre Position herausgefunden haben. 
Das Oberkommando hat neue Informationen über die Geheimpläne der NTF freigegeben."

1597, "ETAK

Wir wissen jetzt, dass Admiral Bosch eine shivanische Kommunikationstechnologie erforscht hat, die Quantenimpulse übermittelt und moduliert. Bosch hat insgeheim ein Forschungsprojekt mit shivanischen Kriegsgefangenen wiederaufleben lassen, das nach der Hadesrebellion von 2335 abgebrochen worden war. Bosch nannte sein Projekt ETAK, die Kurzform für Etamnanki, den Turm, der als Vorbild für die Geschichte über den Turmbau zu Babel gedient haben dürfte."

1598, "Geschichts-Plünderung

Durch Erforschung der archäologischen Entdeckungen über die Uralten kam Bosch an Informationen über die Position des Knossos-Subraumgerätes, das Portal in jene Region der Galaxis, in der die Uralten erstmals auf die Shivaner getroffen sind. Sein ganzer Rassenkrieg war nur eine Tarnung, hinter der er in aller Ruhe die Stätten der Uralten in den vasudanischen Systemen ausplündern konnte. In Deneb lernte er, das Portal zu aktivieren, und er schickte die Trinity los, um das Gerät anzuwerfen."

1599, "Ein infernalischer Pakt

Ein Hauptbestandteil von Boschs Vision eines Neo-Terra war die Idee, sich mit den Shivanern zu verbünden, wenn sie noch einmal in unsere Systeme kommen sollten. Als Bosch erkannte, dass sein Regime am Rande des Zusammenbruchs stand, befahl er seinen Truppen, in den Nebel zu fliegen, um dort Kontakt mit dem Feind herzustellen. Die Verhöre der gefangengenommenen Rebellen haben erbracht, dass nur Boschs direkte Untergebene Zugang zum ETAK-Projekt hatten. Die weiteren Details unterliegen einer für Sie zu hohen Geheimhaltungsstufe."

1600, "Circe

Sie haben jetzt die Freigabe für den Einsatz des GTW-19 Circe. Es handelt sich dabei um eine Weiterentwicklung der elektromagnetischen Schockwerfer. Circe stört Schildsysteme, indem es das Ziel mit einer Welle von harmonischen Fluktuationsströmungen überschwemmt. Diese Energie hat allerdings keinerlei Wirkung auf Panzerung oder isolierte Subsysteme. Aus diesem Grund verwenden Sie Circe am besten zusammen mit einer Zweitwaffe wie dem Maxim oder dem Prometheus, die schwere Schäden am Rumpf des Gegners anrichten können."

1601, "Die Aufklärungsstaffel hat die NTF Iceni gefunden. Bosch hat sich zum zweiten Mal mit den Shivanern in Verbindung gesetzt. Ein Transporter der Azrael-Klasse ist derzeit an dem Schiff angedockt, ein zweiter scheint in der Nähe zu warten. Wir können nicht erkennen, ob Shivaner an Bord der Iceni gegangen sind oder ob Bosch und seine Leute sich an Bord der Transporter begeben wollen."

1602, "Unser Ziel ist es, die $h Iceni und damit die ETAK-Technologie zu erobern. Zwei shivanische Kreuzer bewachen das Schiff, die Azmedaj und die Sammael. Sobald Sie die Kreuzer zerstört haben, werden wir ein Sondereinsatzteam an Bord bringen, das dieses Kommandoschiff der Rebellen in seine Gewalt bringt. Ihr zweites Einsatzziel ist es, unseren Transporter zu beschützen, die $f GVT $f Qeb."

1603, "Soweit wir wissen, befindet sich an Bord der $h Iceni das einzige Exemplar der ETAK-Technologie, das es gibt. Bosch hat sich besondere Mühe gegeben, alle Hinweise auf seine Forschungen zu vernichten. Wenn wir versagen, haben wir keine Chance, das Gerät jemals nachzubauen. Das Oberkommando setzt absolutes Vertrauen in Ihre Fähigkeit, diesen Auftrag erfolgreich abzuschliessen."

1604, "Unser Transporter konnte nicht an der Iceni andocken. Sowohl die Überlebenden der NTF als auch unser Bergungsteam sind nun tot, und wir haben die wertvolle Kommunikationstechnologie verloren. Alle Hinweise auf Boschs ETAK-Projekt sind damit vernichtet. 

Ich muss Ihnen leider mitteilen, dass Ihre Teilnahme am Offiziers-Austauschprogramm mit sofortiger Wirkung endet, auf Anweisung des Vasudanischen Taktischen Befehlsstabes. Ich habe mich für Sie eingesetzt, doch es war zwecklos. Sie mussten gegen eine erdrückende Übermacht antreten, und viele unserer eigenen vasudanischen Piloten starben in diesem Gefecht. Doch das Oberkommando hat die Intensität des shivanischen Angriffs nicht vorhergesehen. 

Sie brauchen sich keine Vorwürfe zu machen, Pilot. Sie sind schliesslich nur ein Mensch."

1605, "Setzen Sie Ihre Staffelpiloten ein, um mehrere Ziele zugleich abzudecken."

1606, "Die GVT Qeb hat die Überlebenden der Iceni gerettet und die Daten von Boschs ETAK-Gerät sichergestellt. 

Das Oberkommando hat diese Daten in die Sicherheitsstufe Omega eingestuft, das heisst, nur wenige Personen mit ausdrücklicher Ermächtigung vom GTVA-Sicherheitsrat haben überhaupt Zugang dazu. Beachten Sie, dass die Weitergabe jeglicher Information über diese Operation nach dem GTVA-Sicherheitserlass der Antares-Konvention, Sektion 15-5-7, als Hochverrat zu bestrafen ist.

Wir sind zu spät gekommen, um den Azrael-Transporter mit Admiral Bosch und seinem Befehlsstab an Bord noch abzufangen. Unsere Befragung der Überlebenden hat ergeben, dass dieses Treffen wohl ziemlich gewalttätig ablief. Die Motive der Shivaner sind unklar, aber es scheint, dass Boschs Experimente ihre Aufmerksamkeit erweckt haben. unsere Aufklärer suchen derzeit nach dem shivanischen Transporter. 

Im Angesicht erdrückender Übermacht haben Sie die shivanischen Kreuzer zerstört, die Iceni beschützt und den Transporter sicher nach Hause geleitet. Es ist wirklich eine Ehre, mit einem Piloten Ihres Kalibers dienen zu dürfen."

1607, "Die Shivaner haben die GVT Qeb zerstört, bevor der Transporter noch von der Iceni abdocken konnte. Sowohl die Überlebenden der NTF als auch unser Bergungsteam sind nun tot, und wir haben die wertvolle Kommunikationstechnologie verloren. Alle Hinweise auf Boschs ETAK-Projekt sind damit vernichtet.

Doch das Oberkommando hat die Intensität des shivanischen Angriffs nicht vorhergesehen.

Sie brauchen sich keine Vorwürfe zu machen, Pilot. Sie sind schliesslich nur ein Mensch."

1608, "Wir hatten es fast geschafft, Pilot. Unser Transporter war nur noch wenige Sekunden von dem rettenden Sprung in den sicheren Subraum entfernt. Sowohl die Überlebenden der NTF als auch unser Bergungsteam sind nun tot, und wir haben die wertvolle Kommunikationstechnologie verloren. Alle Hinweise auf Boschs ETAK-Projekt sind damit vernichtet.

1659, "Um 16.40 Standardzeit entdeckten unsere Aufklärer den shivanischen Transporter mit Admiral Bosch und seinen Führungsoffizieren tief in einer von den Shivanern kontrollierten Zone des Nebels. Eine Staffel Maras hat unsere Aufklärer vertrieben, aber wir kennen jetzt wenigstens die ungefähre Position. Alpha und Beta, Ihr Auftrag lautet, den Azrael-Transporter zu suchen und seinen Antrieb stillzulegen."

1660, "Der Angriff muss schnell durchgeführt werden, bevor der Transporter entkommen kann. Sobald sein Antrieb deaktiviert ist, beschützen Sie den Transporter, bis $f Lambda $f 1 mit dem Bergungsteam eintrifft. Sie werden an dem $h Azrael andocken und das Schiff nach Gamma Draconis zurückschleppen. $f Lambda $f 2 hält sich in Bereitschaft, falls $f Lambda $f 1 versagen sollte."

1661, "Bosch und seinen Führungsstab gefangenzunehmen ist von grösster Wichtigkeit. Wir wissen allerdings nicht, ob sie überhaupt noch am Leben sind und was die Shivaner mit ihnen vorhaben."

1662, "Willkommen auf der GVD Memphis, Terraner. Die Vernichtung der Psamtik und ihrer gesamten Besatzung ist eine Tragödie für alle Vasudaner. Wie sagt unser altes Sprichwort: Ein Volk, das aus grosser Sorge geboren wird, stirbt auch in grosser Sorge. Die Entdeckung des zweiten Knossos-Portals war von grosser Bedeutung, aber es wird keine Expedition dorthin geben. Die alliierten Truppen haben im gesamten Nebelgebiet mehrere Schlachtschiffe der Juggernaut-Klasse geortet, die auf unsere Stellungen zuhalten. Wir stehen an der Schwelle einer neuen shivanischen Invasion, und unsere Sonnensysteme sind erneut in grösster Gefahr. 

Zum zweiten Mal hat das Oberkommando den vollständigen Rückzug aller alliierten Schiffe aus dem Nebelgebiet angeordnet. Wir werden uns sofort ins Capella-System zurückziehen und dort unsere Verteidigung organisieren. Doch nicht einmal die Colossus hat genug Feuerkraft, um eine ganze Flotte von Schlachtschiffen der Juggernaut-Klasse zurückzuschlagen. 

Nach dem Verschwinden des Azrael-Transporters und bei der extremen Verschwiegenheit, mit der die Allianz das ETAK-Projekt behandelt, kann es noch viele Jahre dauern, bevor wir erfahren, was hier draussen wirklich geschehen ist."

1704, "Admiral Petrarch berichtet, dass seine Kanoniere die $h Urobach und all ihre Jäger-Staffeln vernichtet haben - bis auf eine. Da sich die gesamte shivanische Armada jetzt in Richtung auf den terranisch-vasudanischen Raum bewegt, müssen wir die $f Aquitaine so schnell wie möglich da rausholen. Ihr Auftrag lautet, die $f Aquitaine zu beschützen, bis ihr Antriebssystem wieder repariert ist."

1705, "Ein Wartungsteam ist von Gamma Draconis aus schon unterwegs. Die $f GTC $f Agrippa, ein Kriegsschiff der Aeolus-Klasse, eskortiert den $f Argo-Transporter mit der Mannschaft und den benötigten Ersatzteilen.

1706, "Der Wartungsoffizier der $f Aquitaine schätzt, dass die eigentliche Reparatur in wenigen Minuten erledigt werden kann, wenn das Wartungsteam mit den Ersatzteilen erst mal an Bord ist. Das gibt den Shivaner allerdings immer noch genug Zeit, weitere Staffeln zu starten und die $f Aquitaine zu bedrohen."

1707, "In tiefer Trauer nehmen wir Abschied von den 10.000 Offizieren und Mannschaften an Bord der GTD Aquitaine. Sie haben tapfer gekämpft und sind ehrenhaft gefallen.

Eigentlich sollten Sie als nächstes auf die Aquitaine versetzt werden, als Geschwaderführer der 70. Blue Lions. In Anbetracht der jüngsten Ereignisse allerdings haben wir umdisponiert und Sie als Patrouillenflieger zur 12. Flotte in das weit entfernte System Wolf 359 versetzt.

1739, "Aquitaine hier. Beginne Sprungantriebssequenz. Wir sehen uns dann bei Gamma Draconis, Alpha. Danke für Ihre Hilfe."

1740, "Gut gemacht, Alpha. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1741, "Hier spricht die Aquitaine. Rumpfzustand im roten Bereich! Wir brauchen mehr Jäger hier draussen, oder wir schaffen es nicht, Command!"

1742, "Wir haben die Aquitaine verloren!! Alle Einheiten zurück zum Stützpunkt! Einsatz abgebrochen!"

1743, "Wir setzen Verstärkungen ein, Alpha. Bitte warten Sie."

1744, "Wir haben den Antrieb stabilisieren können, aber wir brauchen mehr Zeit hier, Command."

1748, "Als Anführer der 70. Blue Lions der GTD Aquitaine gibt Alpha 1 einem Konvoi Geleitschutz, der aus dem Sonnensystem flieht."

1749, "Willkommen auf der Aquitaine; schön, Sie wiederzusehen. Aufgrund Ihrer hervorragenden Leistungen hat Ihnen die GTVA das Kommando über Ihr eigenes Elite-Jägergeschwader verliehen, die 70. Blue Lions. Das ist eine grosse Ehre, Pilot. Sie erhalten Ihre Anweisungen jetzt direkt vom Kommandodeck.

Als Geschwaderführer der Blue Lions haben Sie die höchste Priorität bei der Auswahl von Schiffen und Waffen, aber wählen Sie Ihre Bewaffnung sorgfältig aus. Ziehen Sie die Informationen in unserer technischen Datenbank zu Rate, wenn Sie sich unschlüssig sind."

1750, "Neun Schlachtschiffe der Sathanas-Klasse sind bis jetzt im Capella-System eingetroffen, und der Geheimdienst hat noch mehr im Nebelgebiet ausgemacht, alle im Anflug auf Sprungknoten in den terranisch-vasudanischen Raum.

Wir stehen an der Schwelle zu einer neuen Apokalypse. Auch wenn die Schlachtschiffe unsere Kriegsschiffe noch nicht angegriffen haben, so zeigt ihr Kurs doch eindeutig Richtung Capella. Wir können über ihre Pläne derzeit nur Vermutungen anstellen, aber diese Entwicklung dürfte für die Allianz auf keinen Fall etwas Gutes bedeuten."

1751, "Das alliierte Oberkommando evakuiert ab sofort alle Mitarbeiter, die nicht unbedingt an ihrem Posten benötigt werden. Der Sicherheitsrat hat einen Plan, wie die Shivaner hier in Capella gestoppt werden sollen, bevor sie in andere Systeme der GTVA eindringen können.

Die 70. Blue Lions werden unseren Konvois Jagdschutz geben, damit sie das System sicher verlassen können. Hier stehen Millionen von Menschenleben auf dem Spiel, Pilot. Wenn wir versagen, sind all unsere Sonnensysteme und Welten in grosser Gefahr."

1752, "Der Erinyes-Jäger

Die GTVA hat soeben den neuentwickelten schweren Jäger der Erinyes-Klasse zum Einsatz freigegeben. Mit seinen acht Geschützbänken hat er genug Feuerkraft, um auf kurze Entfernung gegnerische Ziele schnell auszuschalten. Der Erinyes-Jäger kann Feuerleitrechner für zwei verschiedene Primärsysteme aufnehmen.

Wahrscheinlich müssen Sie den Waffensystemen mehr Energie als üblich zuleiten, um effektiv kämpfen zu können, also nehmen Sie die benötigten Einstellungen vor."

1753, "Der GTW UD-8 Kayserstrahler

Sie dürfen ausserdem den GTW UD-08 Kayserstrahler testen. Für die Dauer der Felderprobung haben nur wenige Einheiten Erlaubnis, diese Waffe einzusetzen. Der Kayserstrahler schleudert fokussierte Miniwellen aus subatomaren Partikeln auf sein Ziel. Beim Auftreffen bricht die Wellenfunktion der Partikel zusammen, wobei sie intensive Mikrostösse von Nullpunkt-Energie emittiert. Der Kayserstrahler ist das erste Ergebnis unserer Erforschung der shivanischen Waffentechnologie."

Wir haben endlich ausreichende Mengen der neuen GTM-11 Infyrno bekommen, einer besonders gegen Jäger wirksamen Bombe. Um die Infyrno einzusetzen, drücken Sie den Sekundärwaffen-Feuerknopf einmal, um die Bombe abzufeuern, und ein weiteres Mal, um sie zu zünden. Eine Anzeige in Ihrem HUD meldet Ihnen jeweils die Entfernung der Bombe zu Ihrem Schiff. Bei der Detonation zerlegt sich die Infyrno in Dutzende von Schrappnells, von denen jedes einzelne wiederum eine hochexplosive Sprengladung enthält."

1755, "In diesem Moment sind ganze Konvois aus Transportern, Frachtern und Sanitätsschiffen unterwegs zu den Sprungknoten zur Vega und nach Epsilon Pegasi. Die Evakuierung der Zivilisten verläuft nach Plan, doch der Angriff des Gegners hat sich weiter verstärkt. Wir haben den Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten blockiert, doch immer noch strömen frische shivanische Truppen in das System."

1756, "Das 53. löst das 309. am Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten ab, und wir setzen das 19. beim Hauptquartier der 3. Flotte als Jagdschutz ein, während wir dort die nicht unbedingt benötigten Stabsmitarbeiter evakuieren. Das Oberkommando braucht genauere Daten über die Juggernaut-Schlachtschiffe, also schicken wir das 91. zur Aufklärung los. Die 70. Blue Lions werden sich sofort zum Epsilon-Pegasi-Sprungknoten begeben."

1757, "Blue Lions, Ihr Auftrag lautet, einen aus vier Schiffen bestehenden Konvoi nach Epsilon Pegasi zu geleiten. Der Verband besteht aus den Mannschaftstransportern $f Lambda $f 1 und $f 2, dem Frachter $f GTFr $f Sulla und dem Sanitätsschiff $f GTM $f Vesalius. Alle verfügen nur über minimale Panzerung und sind extrem verwundbar. Die $f GVCv $f Nebtuu koordiniert den Geleitschutz."

1758, "Um exakt vierzehn-fünfzehn griffen die Shivaner mit ihrer Korvette Abraxis und einer Staffel Manticore-Jäger unseren Konvoi an. Die $f Nebtuu forderte Unterstützung an, darum schicken wir Sie hin. Die Theta-Staffel hält sich als Verstärkung in Bereitschaft. Setzen Sie sie nach Bedarf ein. Viel Glück, Piloten. Die Menschen auf Capella verlassen sich auf Sie."

1759, "Verlassen Sie das Schlachtfeld nicht, bevor Sie die Erlaubnis dazu haben. Einen solchen Fehler sollten Sie bei Ihrem Rang nicht machen."

1760, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Ihr erster Einsatz als Führer der 70. Blue Lions hat bewiesen, dass Sie genau der richtige Offizier für diese Position sind. Die Shivaner haben einen heftigen Angriff durchgeführt, aber Sie und Ihr Geschwader haben sie abgewehrt. Aufgrund Ihres taktischen Geschicks hat der gesamte Konvoi Epsilon Pegasi sicher erreicht."

1761, "Die Shivaner haben einen heftigen Angriff gegen all unsere Konvois durchgeführt. Die Zahl der Verluste geht in die Hunderttausende. Wir haben einfach nicht die Möglichkeit, jedes Schiff zu beschützen, das dieses System verlassen will. Selbst mit Ihrer Elitetruppe, den 70. Blue Lions, konnten Sie nicht alle Einsatzziele erreichen."

1762, "Beide Lambda-Transporter wurden bei dem shivanischen Angriff vernichtet. Tausende von Zivilisten fanden dabei den Tod."

1763, "Beide Lambda-Transporter haben es nach Epsilon Pegasi geschafft. Ihr Einsatz hat Tausende von Menschenleben gerettet."

1764, "Einer der Lambda-Transporter hat den Sprungknoten sicher erreicht. Die Hälfte der Zivilisten starb bei den shivanischen Angriff."

1765, "Rettungskräfte von Vega und Epsilon Pegasi melden jetzt schon Engpässe bei der Versorgung mit lebenswichtigen Gütern und Medikamenten. Der Verlust der Sulla macht das Ganze nur noch schlimmer."

1766, "Wir haben die GTFr Sulla bergen können. Die Vorräte an Bord dieses Frachters werden helfen, die Versorgungsengpässe in Epsilon Pegasi zu lindern."

1767, "Die Zerstörung der GTM Vesalius ist eine Tragödie. Bei der Anzahl der Opfer, die der shivanische Angriff im Capella-System verursacht, ist für uns jedes einzelne Sanitätsschiff sein Gewicht in Gold wert."

1768, "Die GTM Vesalius ist sicher in Epsilon Pegasi angekommen. Das Sanitätsschiff wird dringend gebraucht, um die Flüchtlinge von Capella zu versorgen."

1769, "Ihr Geschwader hat alle Gegner vernichtet. Wenn wir den shivanischen Vormarsch aufhalten wollen, müssen wir jede sich bietende Chance ergreifen, um den Gegner zu schwächen."

1770, "Wir müssen Ihre Einheit jetzt schnellstens zum Hauptquartier der 3. Flotte verlegen. Versammeln Sie Ihre Leute im Bereitschaftsraum."

1771, "Für aussergewöhnliche Führungsqualitäten im Angesicht feindlicher Übermacht verleihen wir Ihnen hiermit die Ehrenspange für Verdienste um die Allianz."

1772, "Truppen"

1773, "Beschützen Sie den Konvoi"

1774, "Gibborim zerstören"

1775, "Geben Sie Lambda 1 und 2 Geleitschutz zum Epsilon-Pegasi-Sprungknoten"

1776, "Vernichten Sie alle gegnerischen Ziele"

1777, "Beschützen Sie das Sanitätsschiff Vesalius"

1778, "Beschützen Sie das Frachtschiff Sulla"

1779, "Wir haben die Abraxis zerstört, aber die Shivaner geben nicht auf!"

1780, "Bleiben Sie in Geleitschutzposition für die Transporter. Die 70. Blue Lions sind hier, um Ihnen zu helfen."

1781, "Nahema-Bomber im Anflug, Zielbezeichnung Scorpio. Fangen Sie diese Staffel ab, Alpha!"

1782, "Wir sterben umsonst, wenn wir heute nicht siegen! Rächt uns!"

1783, "Wir haben die Gibborim zerstört! Gut gemacht, Piloten. Weiter mit Geleitschutz."

1784, "Gute Arbeit, Alpha. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1785, "Der Konvoi hat den Sprungknoten erreicht. Gut gemacht, Alpha! Sichern Sie das Gebiet. und dann zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1786, "Seraphim-Bomber mit Jäger-Geleitschutz sind am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht. Verteidigen Sie die Transporter, Alpha"

1787, "Alpha, Sie sind zu weit hinter den Konvoi zurückgefallen. Hauen Sie die Nachbrenner rein und kommen Sie nach vorn!"

1788, "Bleiben Sie dicht beim Konvoi, Alpha. Bringen Sie ihn sicher zum Knoten!"

1789, "Alpha, Sie sind zu weit vom Konvoi entfernt!"

1790, "Alpha 1, Ihre Aufgabe ist es, den Konvoi zu beschützen. Gehen Sie sofort wieder in Geleitschutz-Position."

1791, "Alpha, wir brauchen Sie hier beim Konvoi! Lassen Sie sich von den Shivanern nicht weglocken!"

1792, "Alpha-Staffel, Sie haben Ihre Befehle. Zuerst die gegnerischen Bomber ausschalten!"

1793, "Die Gibborim ist aus dem Subraum aufgetaucht! Schalten Sie sofort ihre Geschütztürme aus, bevor sie damit den Konvoi zerfetzt!"

1794, "Hier Lambda 1. Rumpf wurde schwer beschädigt. Erbitte Jagdschutz."

1795, "Hier spricht Lambda 1. Rumpfzustand jetzt im roten Bereich! Hunderte werden sterben, wenn Ihr uns hier nicht rausholt!"

1796, "Lambda 2, Erbitte Jagdschutz! Wir halten nicht mehr viel aus!"

1797, "Hier spricht Lambda 2. Wir verrecken hier draussen, Command!"

1798, "Hier spricht die GTM Vesalius. Die Schivaner schiessen uns in Stücke! Wir brauchen mehr Jagdschutz!"

1799, "Vesalius hier. Rumpf bricht gleich auseinander. Unsere Lage ist verzweifelt, Command!"

1800, "Command, hier spricht die Sulla. Wir haben nicht genug Feuerkraft, um diesen Angriff abzuwehren!"

1801, "Command, wir brauchen mehr Jäger! Sonst überleben wir diesen Angriff nicht!"

1802, "Die Sulla ist vernichtet! Konzentrieren Sie sich, Alpha. Wir können uns keine weiteren Verluste mehr leisten!"

1803, "Wir haben Lambda 2 verloren! Die schlachten uns da draussen ab!"

1804, "Lambda 1! Bitte melden, Lambda 1! Wir haben Ihr Signal verloren!"

1805, "Die GTM Vesalius ist zerstört worden. Alle Besatzungsmitglieder sind umgekommen."

1806, "Alpha, die Nebtuu ist zerstört. Alle alliierten Kriegsschiffe sind derzeit im Gefecht. Sie sind auf sich alleine gestellt da draussen."

1807, "Die Shivaner haben unseren gesamten Konvoi ausgelöscht. Zurück zum Stützpunkt, Alpha."

1808, "Die Sulla hat ihren Sprungantrieb aktiviert und ist unterwegs nach Epsilon Pegasi."

1809, "Die Zivilisten sind angekommen. Die Hälfte hat das Gefecht überlebt."

1810, "Der erste Transporter hat Epsilon Pegasi erreicht."

1811, "Die GTM Vesalius has entered the Sprungknoten."

1812, "Hier können wir nichts mehr tun, Alpha. Der Konvoi ist fort. Zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1813, "Dünkirchen"

1814, "Die 70. Blue Lions helfen bei der Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers der 3. Flotte in Capella."

1815, "Um dreiundzwanzig-fünfundvierzig hat das alliierte Oberkommando die sofortige Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers der 3. Flotte im Capella-System angeordnet. Die Anlage dort steht unter schwerem Beschuss durch Jäger und Bomber. Die Shivaner setzen ihre Staffeln von der SD Nebiros aus ein, einem Zerstörer der Ravana-Klasse. Das 19. Geschwader, das zum Schutz des Hauptquartiers eingeteilt war, ist völlig ausradiert worden."

1816, "Die Evakuierung wird wie folgt ablaufen: $f Lambda $f 1, ein Transporter der Argo-Klasse, wird an der Station andocken. Der Grossteil der Stabsmitarbeiter geht an Bord und wird dann zur $f GTD $f Messana gebracht. Das Oberkommando schickt anschliessend einen zweiten Transporter, der den Rest des Führungsstabes abholt. Die Verwundeten sind bereits zum Sanitätsschiff $f GTM $f Galen gebracht worden."

1817, "Nachdem $f Lambda $f 2 an der $f Orion angedockt hat, verlässt die $f Messana das System, und Sie können zu Ihrem Stützpunkt zurückkehren. Sie werden mit den Staffeln Alpha und Delta bei dieser Operation für den Jagdschutz sorgen. Sie müssen das Hauptquartier schützen, die $f Messana und die beiden Transporter. Sobald die Evakuierung abgeschlossen ist, wird die Anlage zerstört."

1818, "Wir haben bereits alle weniger dringend benötigten Stabsmitarbeiter ausgeflogen, daher sollte die Operation recht schnell verlaufen. Mit dieser Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers tritt die Allianz in die letzte Phase ihres Plans, die Shivaner in Capella aufzuhalten."

1819, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Beide Lambda-Transporter haben sicher an der GTD Messana angedockt. Die Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers der 3. Flotte war ein voller Erfolg. Unter Ihrer fähigen Leitung bestätigen die 70. Blue Lions ihren Ruf als eines der besten Elite-Geschwader der Galaktischen Terranisch-Vasudanischen Allianz.

 Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat hat uns seine Strategie mitgeteilt, mit der er die Shivaner im Capella-System festhalten will. Ich werde in einer Stunde zu den Offizieren und Mannschaften der Aquitaine sprechen. Die 70. Blue Lions werden bei der bevorstehenden Operation eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Ich weiss, dass Sie und Ihr Geschwader dieser Herausforderung gewachsen sind."

1820, "Auch wenn wir den ersten Transporter verloren haben, hat wenigstens Lambda 2 sicher an der GTD Messana angedockt. Die Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers der 3. Flotte war zumindest teilweise ein Erfolg. Unter den gegebenen Umständen ist das vielleicht das Beste, was wir erwarten dürfen. Darf ich Sie trotzdem daran erinnern, dass sich Elite-Geschwader ihren Ruf dadurch verdienen, dass sie mehr als das Beste geben.

Ich weiss, dass Sie und Ihr Geschwader dieser Herausforderung gewachsen sind."

1821, "Sorgen Sie dafür, dass ihre Kameraden Ihnen beim Schutz der Transporter auch helfen."

1822, "Auch wenn wir den zweiten Transporter verloren haben, hat wenigstens Lambda 1 sicher an der GTD Messana angedockt. Die Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers der 3. Flotte war zumindest teilweise ein Erfolg. Unter den gegebenen Umständen ist das vielleicht das Beste, was wir erwarten dürfen.

Ich werde in einer Stunde zu den Offizieren und Mannschaften der Aquitaine sprechen. Die 70. Blue Lions werden bei der bevorstehenden Operation eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Ich weiss, dass Sie und Ihr Geschwader dieser Herausforderung gewachsen sind."

1823, "Beide Lambda-Transporter wurden zerstört. Es hätte nicht schlimmer kommen können, als dass der gesamte Führungsstab der 3. Flotte ausgelöscht wurde. Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat hat sein extremes Missfallen darüber ausgedrückt, wie Sie die 70. Blue Lions eingesetzt haben, immerhin ein sogenanntes Elite-Geschwader. Sie sind Ihres Kommandos enthoben, Pilot."

1824, "Der Verlust der GTD Messana ist eine Tragödie. Viele Freunde und Kollegen sind heute zu Tode gekommen, und wir können uns nur immer wieder fragen, was man hätte tun können, um sie zu retten. Als Kommandant der Aquitaine habe ich mein Vertrauen in Sie und Ihr Geschwader gesetzt. Die 70. Blue Lions hatten immerhin den Ruf, eine der besten Einheiten der GTVA zu sein. Aber ein guter Ruf alleine rettet keine Menschenleben. Ein guter Ruf erzielt keine Resultate. Ich habe keine andere Wahl, als Sie Ihres Kommandos zu entheben. Weggetreten, Pilot."

1825, "Setzen Sie Ihre Staffelpiloten ein, um mehrere verbündete Schiffe zugleich zu beschützen."

1826, "Wir haben die GTD Messana verloren. Es hätte nicht schlimmer kommen können, als dass die gesamte Führung der 3. Flotte ausgelöscht wurde. Der GTVA-Sicherheitsrat hat sein extremes Missfallen darüber ausgedrückt, wie Sie die 70. Blue Lions angeführt haben, immerhin ein sogenanntes Elite-Geschwader. Sie sind Ihres Kommandos enthoben, Pilot."

1827, "Setzen Sie Ihre Staffelpiloten ein, um mehrere verbündete Schiffe zugleich zu beschützen."

1828, "Ihre Hartnäckigkeit ist uns positiv aufgefallen, Pilot. Sie haben alle gegnerischen Ziele vernichtet. So, wie wir mit dem Rücken zur Wand stehen, kann jeder Vorteil, den wir herausschlagen, den Unterschied zwischen Vernichtung und Sieg ausmachen."

1829, "Sie haben sich durch Ihre beispielhafte Tapferkeit unter Einsatz Ihres eigenen Lebens als Soldat und Kamerad ausgezeichnet und in bester Tradition des Militärs um die Allianz verdient gemacht. Wir verleihen Ihnen hiermit den Orden der GTVA-Ehrenlegion, die höchste Auszeichnung, die die Galaktische Terranisch-Vasudanische Allianz zu vergeben hat."

1830, "Stabspersonal"

1831, "Geben Sie bei der Evakuierung des Hauptquartiers der 3. Flotte Jagdschutz"

1832, "Lambda 1 vernichtet! Wiederhole: Lambda 1 vernichtet!"

1833, "Wir haben Lambda 2 verloren! Evakuierung abgebrochen!"

1834, "Command, hier ist die Lambda 2. Beginnen jetzt mit dem Andocken."

1835, "Messana, Lambda 2 hier. Wir haben am Kommandoschiff angedockt. Alle überlebenden Besatzungsmitglieder sind sicher an Bord."

1836, "Alpha 1, verteidigen Sie mit Ihrer Rotte diese Einrichtung. Geschätzte Ankunftszeit der Messana in 60 Sekunden. Eine Staffel Manticores mit Zielbezeichnung Aries greift derzeit die Basis an."

1837, "Wie sieht es bei Ihnen aus, Kommandoschiff?"

1838, "Wir haben nur geringe Schäden abbekommen. Evakuierung der nicht unverzichtbaren Besatzung abgeschlossen. Wir haben unsere Verletzten auf die GTM Galen gebracht."

1839, "Hier spricht die GTD Messana. Bereit zur Aufnahme der Transporter."

1840, "Hier ist die Messana! Wir brauchen sofort Jagdschutz hier! Unser Rumpf hat schon erhebliche Beschädigungen!"

1841, "Wir haben die Messana verloren!"

1842, "Hier spricht die GTD Messana. Bitte halten Sie sich von der Anlage fern, wir leiten jetzt die Fernzündungssequenz ein."

1843, "Hier ist die Messana. Aktivieren Subraumantrieb."

1844, "Hier Lambda 1, Messana. Beginne Andocksequenz."

1845, "Bestätigt, Lambda. Messana in Bereitschaft."

1846, "Hier spricht Lambda 1. Andockklammern gesichert. Besatzung steigt um."

1847, "Willkommen auf der Messana. Phase 3 der Evakuierung zu 50% abgeschlossen."

1848, "Lambda 1 aktiviert Subraumantrieb."

1849, "In Ordnung, Lambda 2. Weitermachen."

1850, "Bestätigt. Alpha-Staffel, geben Sie Geleitschutz für Lambda 2."

1851, "Beginne jetzt mit der Andocksequenz, Messana. Bitte warten."

1852, "Roger, Lambda 2. Sie haben es fast geschafft."

1853, "Lambda 2 hier. Andocksequenz abgeschlossen. Sprung nach Ihrem Ermessen, Messana."

1854, "Hier spricht die GTM Galen. Wir aktivieren jetzt unseren Subraumantrieb."

1855, "Kommandoschiff hier. Wir haben schwere Schäden abbekommen. Die Aussenhülle ist auf mehreren Decks aufgerissen. Die Anzahl der Opfer steigt ständig. Wir brauchen mehr Jagdschutz, Alpha 1."

1856, "Hier spricht das Kommandoschiff, Alpha 1. Unser Rumpf hat zu schwere Schäden abbekommen. Fangen Sie die shivanischen Raketen ab, wir überstehen keine weiteren Treffer!"

1857, "Eine Staffel Nahema-Bomber ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht! Zielbezeichnung Pisces!"

1858, "Sprungsignatur nähert sich! Feindliche Konfiguration!"

1859, "Pisces wurde eliminiert."

1860, "Wir haben die Cancer-Staffel unschädlich gemacht."

1861, "Taurus-Staffel ausgeschaltet."

1862, "Empfangen Anflug-Signatur! Ravana-Konfiguration! Es ist die Nebiros, Piloten! Ziehen Sie sich sofort zurück ! Wir holen Sie da raus!"

1863, "Die Nebiros hat unsere Anlage vernichtet! Alle Einheiten Abstand halten!"

1864, "Zurück zum Stützpunkt, Alpha, und das ist ein Befehl! Fangen Sie keinen Kampf an, den Sie nicht gewinnen können!"

1865, "Einsatz abgebrochen, Blue Lions. Zurück zur Aquitaine."

1866, "Gut gemacht, Blue Lions. Sichern Sie das Gebiet, und fliegen Sie zurück zum Stützpunkt."

1867, "Die Grosse Raumschlacht"

1868, "Die 70. Blue Lions nehmen an einem Scheinangriff auf den Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten teil."

1869, "Exodus

Bei Verlusten von mehr als einhunderttausend und bei immer mehr shivanischen Einheiten im Anflug haben wir nicht die leiseste Chance, Capella halten zu können. Unsere einzige Hoffnung besteht darin, das System abzuriegeln und damit zu verhindern, dass die Invasion sich auf andere terranisch-vasudanische Welten ausbreitet. Wenn wir den Vormarsch der Shivaner nicht aufhalten, entfesseln wir einen Zweiten Grossen Krieg, einen Konflikt, den wir auf gar keinen Fall überleben würden. Die Lucifer-Flotte, die wir vor 32 Jahren besiegt haben, war nichts im Vergleich zu der Stärke dieser Armada. Das Oberkommando will aber jeden einzelnen Terraner aus dem System herausholen."

1870, "Eine Subraum-Anomalie

Mehr als 80 shivanische Schlachtschiffe der Juggernaut-Klasse sind jetzt rund um die Sonne Capella in Wartestellung. Forschungsschiffe, die ihre Aktivitäten überwachen, haben ein anormales Subraumfeld im Umkreis der Juggernaut-Flotte entdeckt. Auch wenn wir das Feld mit unseren Instrumenten kaum anmessen können, ist seine Intensität im Laufe der letzten zweiundsiebzig Stunden doch stetig angestiegen. Wir wissen seit dem Grossen Krieg, dass die Shivaner über fortgeschrittene Subraumtechnologien verfügen, aber dieses Feld übertrifft unsere schlimmsten Befürchtungen. Die Shivaner machen eventuell eine neue Waffe scharf, von der wir nicht die leiseste Ahnung haben."

1871, "Das Opfer

Es laufen Vorbereitungen zur Zerstörung des Epsilon-Pegasi-Sprungknotens. Ein Zerstörer aus der Zeit des Grossen Krieges, die GTD Bastion, fliegt mit mehreren Mesonensprengköpfen dort hin, die im Inneren des Sprungknotens zur Detonation gebracht werden sollen. Unsere Wissenschaftler glauben, eine Explosion ausreichender Grösse könne den Sprungknoten kollabieren lassen, wie damals vor 32 Jahren bei der Vernichtung der Lucifer. Die Detonation der Reaktoren der Lucifer verschloss den Sol-Sprungknoten in Delta Serpentis und kappte somit jeglichen Kontakt zur Erde. Die Bastion hat ihren Umbau im Vega-System abgeschlossen und fliegt nun nach Capella."

1872, "Wird die Strategie funktionieren?

Skeptiker haben argumentiert, dass die Shivaner zu Beginn des Grossen Krieges Sprünge zwischen einzelnen Systemen auch ohne Sprungknoten vorgenommen haben, in Ross 128, Ikeya, Vega und anderen Systemen. Dennoch versichern unsere Wissenschaftler, dass dieser Plan funktionieren wird. Auch wenn die Shivaner uns unbekannte Sprungknoten benutzen oder solche, die zu instabil sind für terranische oder vasudanische Schiffe, so sind sie doch ebenso auf Sprungknoten angewiesen wie wir. Trotzdem sehen wir diese Strategie nur als temporäre Massnahme an."

1873, "Endspiel

Sobald wir alle zivilen und militärischen Mitarbeiter aus dem Capella-System evakuiert haben, schicken wir einen zweiten Zerstörer, ebenfalls mit Mesonenbomben, durch den Capella-Sprungknoten im Vega-System. Wenn wir es schaffen, beide Sprungknoten kollabieren zu lassen, hat die Allianz die Shivaner in diesem System eingesperrt. Falls wir aber versagen, ist unsere Vernichtung so gut wie sicher.

Entweder halten wir sie auf, Piloten, oder wir sterben bei dem Versuch."

1874, "Die $f GTD $f Bastion fliegt um achtzehn-fünfunddreissig ins Capella-System ein. Wir schicken das 116. als Geleitschutz mit, um das Kriegsschiff in Position zu bringen. Unsere vorgeschobenen Beobachter rund um die Juggernaut-Flotte fordern Verstärkung an, darum senden wir das 83. dorthin. Das 309. hilft den Truppen am Vega-Sprungknoten, und was die 70. Blue Lions angeht, mit denen haben wir etwas ganz Besonderes vor."

1875, "Ihr Auftrag lautet, ein Ablenkungsmanöver am Gamma-Draconis-Sprungknoten zu veranstalten. Sie werden einen Scheinangriff durchführen, als Köder für die shivanische Armada. Die $f Colossus und ihr Kampfverband werden in der Nähe des Sprungknotens in Stellung gehen. Indem wir unsere Feuerkraft so bündeln, ziehen wir dort den Schwerpunkt der shivanischen Offensive auf uns. In der Zwischenzeit kann die $f Bastion auf der anderen Seite des Systems den Sprungknoten nach Epsilon Pegasi vernichten."

1876, "Ihr Einsatzziel ist simpel: Zerstören Sie alle feindlichen Objekte. Beachten Sie aber, dass wahrscheinlich keine Verstärkungen zur Verfügung stehen werden. In ihrem letzten Gefecht wurden die Jägerhangars der Colossus schwer in Mitleidenschaft gezogen. Sie werden also da draussen durchhalten müssen, bis die Techniker die Flugdecks wieder einsatzbereit hinkriegen. Viel Glück, Pilot."

1877, "Die Colossus ist zerstört. Mehr als dreissigtausend Offiziere und Mannschaften, unsere Kollegen, Landsleute und Freunde, fanden in dieser Schlacht den Tod. Das mächtigste und stärkste terranisch-vasudanische Kriegsschiff, das es jemals gab, das zu bauen zwanzig Jahre dauerte, wurde innerhalb weniger Minuten vernichtet.

Das Oberkommando weiss, dass Sie nichts hätten tun können, um die Colossus zu retten. Viele Ihrer Geschwaderkameraden wurden getötet, und Sie haben Glück, dass Sie das Gefecht überlebt haben. Doch wir haben jetzt keine Zeit, unsere Toten zu beklagen. Wir haben einen Job zu erledigen, und wenn wir bei dieser Aufgabe versagen, werden noch viele Millionen mehr leiden und sterben.

Die 70. Blue Lions werden ausschwärmen, um der Bastion zu helfen. Melden Sie sich schnellstens im Bereitschaftsraum."

1878, "Sie hätten nichts tun können, um die Colossus zu retten."

1879, "Verlassen Sie das Schlachtfeld nicht, bevor Sie den Befehl dazu haben. Das sollten Sie aber langsam wissen, Pilot."

1880, "Zerstören Sie die Frachter"

1881, "Zerstören Sie die Baal"

1882, "Schalten Sie alle Jäger aus, die sich dem Schlachtfeld nähern"

1883, "Gamma-Staffel schliesst zur Formation mit Ihnen auf, Alpha."

1884, "Das nennen Sie eine Flotte, Command? Wir könnten hier gut noch etwas Hilfe gebrauchen."

1885, "Halten Sie sich von dem Kreuzer fern, Alpha. Konzentrieren Sie sich auf die Jäger, und lassen Sie unsere Grosskampfschiffe ihre Arbeit erledigen."

1886, "Da kommen ein paar Jäger aus dem Systemkern auf uns zu! fangen Sie sie ab!"

1887, "Munitionieren Sie jetzt lieber Ihre Waffen auf, wenn nötig... das hier ist noch nicht vorbei."

1888, "Ein Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse ist von Gamma Draconis rübergekommen."

1889, "Command, wir orten einen Kreuzer der Rakshasa-Klasse im Anflug aus Gamma Draconis."

1890, "Command, die Shivaner haben vier unverteidigte Frachter im System. Die Schlachtschiffe in der Nähe der Sonne haben auf unser Erscheinen nicht reagiert."

1891, "Weitermachen, Colossus. Wir schicken unsere Flotte, um die Frachter anzugreifen."

1892, "Ein Zerstörer der Ravana-Klasse ist aus dem Subraum aufgetaucht. Die machen jetzt wirklich Druck hier!"

1893, "Die Ravana ist erledigt, aber wir haben schwerste Schäden abbekommen. Erbitten Lagebericht, Command."

1894, "Command, ein shivanisches Schlachtschiff ist in Reichweite aufgetaucht. Wie sieht es mit der Bastion aus?"

1895, "Hier spricht die Stalwart. Wir haben ernste Treffer abbekommen!"

1896, "Hier ist die Heket. Unsere Situation ist bedrohlich. Mehrere wichtige Systeme wurden schon beschädigt."

1897, "Khepri an Command. Noch ein direkter Treffer, und wir sind erledigt! Bis auf die Brückenmannschaft wurde die gesamte Besatzung in die Rettungskapseln geschickt!"

1898, "Ein zweiter Kreuzer der Cain-Klasse ist angekommen, Zielbezeichnung Baal."

1899, "Die SC Hela, ein Kreuzer der Lilith-Klasse, ist im System angekommen und unterwegs zu Ihnen."

1900, "Colossus hier. Command, unsere Schiffshülle wird offenbar jeden Moment aufreissen. Wir haben der Bastion so viel Zeit verschafft, wie wir konnten. Hoffen wir, dass dieser Plan funktioniert."

1901, "Command, das shivanische Schlachtschiff schiesst uns in Stücke! Wir können es nicht mehr lange aufhalten!"

1902, "Gamma-Staffel schwärmt aus."

1903, "Alpha, die schweren Bomber der Delta-Staffel stehen Ihnen jetzt zur Verfügung."

1904, "Colossus, wir holen Sie da raus. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb."

1905, "Einsatz abbrechen! Alle Einheiten zurück zum Stützpunkt! Alpha, Sie werden zur Unterstützung der Bastion abkommandiert."

1906, "Die Situation am Epsilon-Pegasi-Knoten scheint noch nicht geklärt zu sein."

1907, "Befolgen Sie Ihre Befehle, Colossus! Springen Sie - jetzt!"

1908, "Negativ, Command. Wir werden sie hier aufhalten. Bringen Sie nur die Bastion durch!"

1909, "Kampf der Titanen II"

1910, "Die 70. Blue Lions geben der Bastion Geleitschutz zum Epsilon-Pegasi-Sprungknoten."

1911, "Die $f GTD $f Bastion ist mit einer Ladung Mesonen-Sprengköpfe unterwegs zum Epsilon-Pegasi-Sprungknoten. Wir werden die $f Bastion innerhalb des Sprungknotens sprengen, um eine Subraumverzerrung zu erschaffen, die das Capella-System abriegelt. Wenn die $f Bastion dieses Ziel nicht erreicht, werden die Shivaner unsere angrenzenden Systeme überrennen."

1912, "Der Geleitschutz der $f Bastion wurde bereits schwer dezimiert. Drei Schiffe sind nur noch übrig: die $f Templar, die $f Malta und die $f Ertanax, alles Kreuzer der Aeolus-Klasse. Die Shivaner schicken weiter eine Welle Jäger und Bomber nach der anderen heran. Von den ursprünglichen Jägerstaffeln der $f Bastion hat nur eine Handvoll das Gemetzel überlebt."

1913, "Die Staffeln Alpha, Delta und Beta werden zur Verstärkung der Bastion zugeteilt. Fangen Sie die gegnerischen Bomber ab, bevor sie in Schussreichweite kommen. Sie werden dazu mit Trebuchet-Raketen ausgerüstet, die eine effektive Reichweite von vier Kilometern besitzen. Die Gamma-Staffel fliegt Perseus-Abfangjäger und wird sich um die gegnerischen Jäger kümmern."

1914, "Der grösste Teil der Flotte wehrt einen starken Angriff am Vega-Sprungknoten ab. Tausende von Zivilisten warten noch auf ihre Evakuierung, und der Feind strömt immer weiter von Gamma Draconis heran. Wir werden keine zweite Chance bekommen, das hier durchzuziehen. Wenn wir versagen, lösen wir damit den Zweiten Shivanischen Krieg aus. Wir müssen die $f Bastion um jeden Preis durchbringen."

1915, "Beschützen Sie die Bastion"

1916, "Geben Sie der Bastion Geleitschutz zum Epsilon-Pegasi-Sprungknoten"

1917, "Die haben mich ziemlich schwer getroffen. Die Diagnoseprogramme meinen, der Kern hätte was abbekommen, aber die Strahlenwerte sind normal. Sieht man von hinten irgendwas an meinem Antrieb?"

1918, "Schön, dass Sie da sind, Alpha. Uns geht es hier gar nicht gut. Ich dachte schon, Command hätte uns vergessen."

1919, "Wir haben Beta 2 verloren! Ich scheine einen Querschläger abbekommen zu haben. Leichte Schäden an den Stabilisatoren. Alle Systeme grün. Ist ein zähes, kleines Schiffchen..."

1920, "Die zielen auf unsere Aeolus-Kreuzer! Wenn wir die als Geleitschutz verlieren, ist die Bastion wehrlos!"

1921, "Der Rumpf der Bastion ist in kritischem Zustand! Wir schaffen es nicht!"

1922, "Die Bastion ist noch 4500 Meter vom Sprungknoten entfernt. Geschätzte Ankunftszeit in fünf Minuten."

1923, "Die Bastion ist bis auf 3000 Meter heran. Wir haben es fast geschafft! Kontakt in drei Minuten!"

 Der Sicherheitsrat hat dem Einsatz der $f GTD Nereid zugestimmt. Der Zerstörer wird vom Vega-System aus starten und den Sprungknoten in fünfzehn Minuten zerstören. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt müssen wir die Evakuierung von Capella abgeschlossen haben. Jedes Schiff, das zurückbleibt, sitzt zusammen mit der shivanischen Armada in der Falle.

Ihr Einsatzziel ist die Verteidigung unserer Konvois, die durch den Vega-Sprungknoten fliehen. Frachtschiffe, Truppentransporter, Sanitätsschiffe und die Überreste der alliierten Flotte befinden sich bereits im Transit. Diese Konvois werden von starken Bomberverbänden angegriffen. Wenn wir ihnen keinen Geleitschutz geben, werden Tausende sterben.

Ihr zweites Einsatzziel ist es, alle shivanischen Kriegsschiffe am Einflug in den Vega-Sprungknoten zu hindern. Die alliierte Flotte ist aufgerieben, also muss, um das Leben aller Menschen und Vasudaner zu retten, der Krieg hier enden. Sobald die $f Nereid vor Ort ist, werden Sie die Erlaubnis erhalten, den Vega-Sprungknoten zu benutzen und das System zu verlassen."

Dabei handelt es sich um eine gemeinsame terranisch-vasudanische Unternehmung, mit dem Ziel, die letzten vasudanischen Fanatiker auszurotten, die sich selbst 'Lichthammer' nennen."

1995, "Um 21.30 Uhr haben Lichthammer-Agenten sich unter die vasudanischen Offiziere gemischt, um die $f GVD $f Anhur zu entführen, einen Zerstörer der Typhon-Klasse, derzeit im Vasuda-System im Einsatz.

1996, "Grossadmiral Khu und andere hochrangige Mitglieder der Admiralität waren an Bord der $f Anhur, um sich eine Demonstration der neuen Scarab-Stealth-Prototypen anzusehen. Sollten die Rebellen versuchen, die Prototypen oder die Offiziere in ihre Gewalt zu bringen, müssen wir schnell eingreifen."

1997, "Dies ist ein schrecklicher Verlust. Ihre Unfähigkeit hat dazu geführt, dass der Lichthammer mit der Anhur, etlichen hochrangigen vasudanischen Geiseln und den Stealth-Prototypen entkommen konnte! Wir schicken ein anderes Team, um uns all das wiederzuholen. Sie können wegtreten."

1998, "Sie haben verhindert, dass der Lichthammer mit dem eroberten Zerstörer fliehen konnte. Beim nächsten Mal werden sie also etwas schwächer sein. Aber das ist nur ein geringer Trost für die Geiseln an Bord der Anhur. Wir müssen diese Geissel ein für allemal ausrotten!"

Die Vasudaner sind bereit, Verhandlungen zu führen, um uns Zeit für einen Befreiungsversuch zu verschaffen."

2018, "Der vasudanische Geheimdienst glaubt, dass der $h Lichthammer Grossadmiral Khu von den anderen Offizieren getrennt und an Bord des $h Isis-Transporters gebracht hat. Die anderen Geiseln wurden auf zwei $h Taurus-Frachter verteilt. Der dritte $h Taurus enthält die Stealth-Prototypen."

2019, "Ihr Auftrag lautet, alle drei Frachter zu scannen und das Schiff mit den Prototypen an Bord zu vernichten. Sobald Sie dieses Ziel erreicht haben, halten Sie sich für weitere Befehle zur Verfügung. Auf keinen Fall dürfen Sie auf eines der Schiffe feuern, die die Geiseln an Bord haben."

2045, "Ihre wichtigste Aufgabe ist es, die Frachter daran zu hindern, an die $h Tanis anzudocken. Wir müssen die Geiseln zurückholen, und das werden wir nicht mehr können, wenn sie einmal an Bord eines Zerstörers sind. Wenn Sie das Rendezvous verhindern, schicken wir Truppentransporter mit Sonderkommandos, um die Frachter zu entern und die Geiseln zu befreien."

2046, "Tun Sie alles, was nötig ist, um die Sicherheit der Geiseln zu gewährleisten. Wir wissen nicht, was der Lichthammer noch an Einheiten im System hat, aber Sie werden sich um sie kümmern müssen. Sobald die Geiseln ausser Gefahr sind, vernichten Sie die übrigen Lichthammer-Schiffe."

2047, "Wir haben Meldungen bekommen, dass unsere Truppen im Sirius-System in Kürze den letzten bekannten Lichthammer-Aussenposten angreifen wollen.

Willkommen auf Vega, Fähnrich. Ich bin Leutnant Loukakis, Geschwaderführer der 53. Hammerheads. Sie wurden unserer Einheit zugeteilt. Die Hammerheads sind ein Raumüberlegenheits-Geschwader. Wir fliegen hier den Myrmidon-Jäger, eine Neuentwicklung als Ersatz für die alten GTF Ulysses. Der Myrmidon ist eine terranisch-vasudanische Gemeinschaftsentwicklung, ein sehr vielseitiges Schiffchen mit ausgezeichneten Werten bei Geschwindigkeit, Wendigkeit, Panzerung und Waffenzuladung."

Die 53. Hammerheads wurden während des Grossen Krieges gegründet. Damals dienten wir auf der GTD Bastion, dem besten Schiff in der Geschichte der terranischen Raumfahrt. Sie wissen das vielleicht nicht mehr, aber die Piloten, die 2335 die SD Lucifer vernichtet haben, waren auf der Bastion stationiert, und einige davon waren Hammerheads. Bei den 53. sind Sie Teil einer langen und stolzen Tradition."

Als die Explosion der Lucifer damals den Sprungknoten zum Sol-System zerstörte und damit jede Verbindung zur Erde kappte, überstellte das Oberkommando die Bastion zur 4. Flotte nach Vega. Seitdem ist die Vega unser Zuhause. Inzwischen hat das Oberkommando die Bastion ausser Dienst gestellt und ihre Geschwader auf einen moderneren Zerstörer der Hecate-Klasse verlegt. Wir gehören jetzt zur GTD Aquitaine, dem Flaggschiff der 3. Flotte auf Capella."

Wenn Sie in dieser Richtung noch etwas Nachholbedarf haben, wäre jetzt ein guter Zeitpunkt, das zu erledigen."

Da dies Ihr erster Kampfeinsatz ist, werden Sie mit den Standardwaffen ausgerüstet: dem Subach HL-7, den ungelenkten Tempest- und den wärmegesteuerten Rockeye-Raketen.

2150, "Willkommen beim Modul TSM-103c, Pilot. Bitte betätigen Sie die Steuerung erst, wenn ich es Ihnen sage. Sie werden durchfallen, wenn Sie sich nicht genau an meine Anweisungen halten."

2151, "Die erste Funktion, die Sie lernen, ist das Erfassen von Zielen. [Drücken Sie $t$] Erfassen Sie meinen Jäger."

2152, "Unten links in Ihrem HUD ist Ihre Zielansicht. Die oberen Zeilen darüber geben den Namen und die Klasse des erfassten Zieles an."

2153, "Die Zeile darunter meldet die Entfernung zum Ziel sowie seine Geschwindigkeit."

2154, "Die eckigen Klammern um mein Schiff bedeuten, dass ich Ihr derzeitiges Ziel bin."

2155, "Sobald ich aus Ihrem Blickfeld herausfliege, erscheint die Randanzeige. Sie zeigt in die Richtung, in die Sie abdrehen müssen, um sich wieder Ihrem Ziel zuzuwenden."

2156, "Diese Anzeige bewegt sich demzufolge, während ich um Sie herumfliege, denn sie zeigt ja immer in Richtung auf Ihr Ziel."

2157, "Achten Sie darauf, wie sich die Dreiecke voneinander entfernen. Je weiter sie auseinander stehen, desto weiter müssen Sie das Schiff drehen, um Ihr Ziel ins Sichtfeld zu bekommen."

2158, "Achten Sie bitte auch noch auf die Zahl bei der Anzeige. Das ist die Entfernung zu Ihrem Ziel."

2159, "Die runde Anzeige unten auf dem HUD ist das Radar. Eigene Schiffe werden in Grün angezeigt, Gegner in Rot. Schiffe direkt vor Ihnen erscheinen in der Mitte des Radarschirms."

2160, "Drehen Sie jetzt mit Ihrer Flugsteuerung Ihr Schiff so lange, bis mein Schiff in der Mitte Ihrer Zielvorrichtung erscheint."

2161, "Gut. Jetzt bleiben Sie in dieser Position."

2162, "Jetzt drehen Sie wieder in Richtung auf mein Schiff."

2163, "[Drücken Sie $m$] Passen Sie Ihre Geschwindigkeit der meinen an."

2164, "Passen Sie Ihre Geschwindigkeit jetzt der meinen an. Sie müssen meinen Anweisungen folgen, wenn Sie dieses Modul erfolgreich abschliessen wollen."

2165, "Links von der Zieleinrichtung ist die Geschwindigkeitsanzeige. Das grosse M neben der momentanen Geschwindigkeit zeigt an, dass Sie Ihre Geschwindigkeit an die Ihres Zieles angepasst haben."

2166, "Jetzt möchte ich, dass Sie beschleunigen, indem sie [$a$] drücken und bis auf weniger als 125 Meter an mich heranfliegen. Aber stossen Sie nicht mit meinem Schiff zusammen."

2167, "Gut. Jetzt bremsen Sie ab. Drücken Sie dazu [$z$], bis Sie auf 200 Meter hinter mich zurückgefallen sind."

2168, "Gut gemacht. Jetzt üben wir den Einsatz der Nachbrenner. Schalten Sie mit [$tab$] Ihre Nachbrenner ein, Pilot."

2169, "Die Anzeige links von Ihrer Geschwindigkeitsanzeige gibt an, wieviel Nachbrenner-Kraft noch zur Verfügung steht. Bitte beachten Sie, dass Ihr Antrieb diese Reserve sehr schnell aufbraucht."

2170, "Diese zusätzliche Geschwindigkeit ist sehr nützlich für schnelle Ausweichmanöver oder Spurts über grössere Entfernungen. Behalten Sie Ihre maximale Geschwindigkeit bei [< oder $\$]. Versuchen Sie es jetzt."
 
2171, "Jetzt bringen Sie Ihren Jäger zum völligen Stillstand. Drücken Sie dazu bitte die [$backspace$]-Taste."

2172, "Drohne 01 ist am Sprungpunkt aufgetaucht. Erfassen Sie sie als Ziel. [Drücken Sie $t$]"

2173, "Gut. Jetzt folgen Sie mir. Beachten Sie, wie Ihre Geschwindigkeit sich automatisch ändert, um sich an meine anzupassen."

2174, "Die Anzeige links von Ihrer Geschwindigkeitsanzeige gibt an, wieviel Nachbrenner-Kraft noch zur Verfügung steht. Bitte beachten Sie, dass diese Reserve sehr schnell aufgebraucht ist."

2175, "Fliegen Sie jetzt bis auf 100 Einheiten an sie ran, und halten Sie dann an. Drücken sie die [$backspace$]-Taste. Passen Sie auf, dass Sie nicht zu schnell fliegen."

2176, "Gut gemacht. Sie haben gemerkt, dass es eine Weile dauert, bis das Schiff völlig stillsteht."

2177, "Feuern Sie jetzt Ihre Primärwaffe auf Drohne 01 ab [drücken Sie $left ctrl$] Treffen Sie sie ein paarmal, aber zerstören Sie sie nicht."

2178, "Sie hatten Befehl, Drohne 01 nicht zu zerstören, Pilot."

2179, "Fast in der Mitte Ihres HUD wird der Rumpfzustand Ihres Zieles angezeigt. Sie sehen, dass er nicht mehr 100% beträgt wie zu Beginn."

2180, "Diese Information ist auch oben rechts in Ihrer Zielansicht verfügbar."

2181, "Jetzt zerstören Sie Drohne 01. [Drücken Sie $left ctrl$]"

2182, "Gute Arbeit."

2183, "Schauen wir mal, wie schnell Sie diese neuen Drohnen vernichten können. Zielen Sie auf die Gegner, drücken sie [$h$], und zerstören Sie sie mit Ihren Subach HL-7 [drücken Sie $left ctrl$]. Die HL-7 sind Standardbewaffnung für alle Myrmidon-Raumjäger."

2184, "Gut gemacht. Damit wäre das Modul TSM-103c abgeschlossen."

2185, "Die meisten Einsätze enden mit der Aufforderung, zum Stützpunkt zurückzukehren. Verlassen Sie das Schlachtfeld keinesfalls, bevor Sie diese Erlaubnis erhalten haben."

2186, "Ihr Navigationscomputer wird automatisch mit den richtigen Koordinaten gefüttert. Alles, was Sie zu tun haben, ist, Ihren Subraumantrieb zu aktivieren. Tun Sie das mit der Tastenkombination [$Alt-J$]."

2190, "Die TSM-Einheiten sind als Teil der GTVA-Kampfausbildung oder zur Prüfung qualifizierter Piloten zugelassen, sie ersetzen aber weder echte Gefechtserfahrung noch die Ausbildung vor Ort."

2191, "Gut gemacht, Pilot. Damit beenden Sie erfolgreich das Modul TSM-103b zur Qualifikation der Klasse B für den Raumjäger Myrmidon. Sie können jetzt weitermachen beim Trainingssimulator-Modul TSM-103a."

2192, "Ihre Leistung entsprach nicht den Anforderungen für Modul TSM-103b zur Qualifikation der Klasse B für den Raumjäger Myrmidon. Sie erhalten keinen Zugang zum nächsten Ausbildungsmodul, solange Sie dieses Modul nicht erfolgreich abgeschlossen haben."

2208, "[Drücken Sie $t$] Erfassen Sie zunächst meinen Jäger."

2209, "Im Kampf müssen Sie Ihre Ziele sehr schnell erfassen. Mit mehreren Jägerstaffeln und Kriegsschiffen werden Sie nicht die Zeit haben, alle Ziele in Sensorenreichweite durchzugehen, um ein bestimmtes zu finden. Schauen wir uns daher mal einige Kontrollen an, die Ihnen helfen, Ziele effizienter zu orten."

2210, "Zwei Drohnen werden für diesen ersten Teil der Übung eingesetzt."

2211, "Sie haben eine Zielkontrolle, die es Ihnen ermöglicht, automatisch das nächstgelegene feindliche Ziel zu erfassen [$h$]. Wenn Sie diesen Taste wiederholt drücken, blättern Sie durch alle feindlichen Ziele in der Reihenfolge ihrer Entfernung zu Ihnen."

2212, "Zielen Sie auf Drohne 01 mit Ihrer Feindzielsteuerung. [Drücken Sie $h$]"

2213, "Gut. Jetzt zielen Sie auf Drohne 02. [Drücken Sie $h$]"

2214, "Ausgezeichnet."

2215, "Nun schauen wir uns eine weitere hilfreiche Zielkontrolle an. Als GTVA-Jägerpilot werden Sie oft grössere Schiffe verteidigen müssen, von Truppentransportern bis zu Zerstörern. Für diese Simulation nehmen wir einmal einen Frachter der Triton-Klasse."

2216, "Bitte beachten Sie, dass der Name und Rumpfzustand des Frachters in einem Fenster rechts von Ihrer Zielvorrichtung erscheinen. Diese Geleitschutzliste zeigt Ihnen jederzeit den aktuellen Zustand Ihrer Schutzbefohlenen an."

2217, "Sie können einzelne Schiffe aus dieser Geleitschutzliste erfassen, indem Sie die Geleitschutz-Zielkontrolle benutzen. Erfassen Sie jetzt den Frachter. [Drücken Sie $e$]."

2218, "Gut gemacht. Bei jedem Geleitschutz-Einsatz ist es wichtig, dass Sie dicht bei den Schiffen bleiben, deren Schutz Ihnen anvertraut wurde. Mit der Geleitschutz-Zielkontrolle können Sie diese Schiffe effizienter orten."

2219, "Bitte beachten Sie, dass auf der Geleitschutzliste nicht nur die Schiffe auftauchen können, die Sie beschützen sollen, sondern jedes grössere Ziel, sei es verbündet oder feindlich. Dadurch können Sie sich schnell über den Status aller Schiffe mit taktischer oder strategischer Bedeutung informieren."

2220, "Schauen wir uns noch einmal an, was wir bis hier behandelt haben."

2221, "Jetzt zielen Sie auf Drohne 02. [Drücken Sie $h$]."

2222, "Jetzt erfassen Sie den Frachter mit Ihrer Geleitschutz-Zielkontrolle. [Drücken Sie $e$]."

2223, "Gut gemacht."

2224, "Im Modul TSM-103c haben Sie geübt, mit Ihren HL-7 zu feuern. Wir wollen uns nun Ihre Primär- und Sekundärwaffen etwas genauer ansehen."

2225, "Ihre Waffenzuladung wird rechts von Ihrer Zielvorrichtung angezeigt. Die primären Bordgeschütze stehen über den sekundären Raketen."

2226, "Benutzen Sie den Primärwaffen-Wählschalter [drücken Sie $.$], um entweder eine oder beide Bordkanonen zum Feuern auszuwählen. Beide Kanonen simultan abzufeuern verursacht schwerere Schäden, beansprucht aber auch die Energiereserven Ihres Jäger mehr."

2227, "Der Myrmidon-Raumjäger verfügt über drei Raketenlafetten. Als Neuling dürfen Sie die ungelenkte Tempest-Rakete und die wärmesuchende Rockeye benutzen. Üben wir erstmal den Umgang mit der Tempest."

2228, "Machen Sie mit der Sekundärwaffenauswahl [drücken Sie $/$] Ihre Tempest-Raketen scharf."

2229, "Gut. Tempestraketen sind ungelenkte Geschosse. Diese Gefechtsköpfe haben kein Zielsystem, sondern fliegen in die Richtung, in die sie abgefeuert werden. Daher sind sie auf kürzere Entfernungen am wirkungsvollsten. Sofern Sie nicht sehr präzise zielen können, ist es sehr schwer, mit einer Tempest zu treffen."

2230, "Wählen Sie jetzt Drohne 01 mit Ihrer Feindzielsteuerung aus [drücken Sie $h$]."

2231, "Gut. Zerstören Sie Drohne 01 mit Ihren Tempest-Raketen [drücken Sie die $spacebar$]. Verringern Sie die Distanz, falls nötig."

2232, "Gut gemacht. Die Tempest ist vielleicht nicht so zielsicher wie eine hitze- oder zielsuchende Rakete, aber dafür kann eine Myrmidon bis zu 320 dieser Schätzchen mitführen. Eine volle Salve Tempestraketen macht kurzen Prozess mit einem gegnerischen Jäger."

2233, "Um ihre Wirksamkeit zu erhöhen, benutzen Sie sie in Kombination mit Ihren Subach HL-7. Während die Laser die Schilde Ihres Zieles durchlöchern, treffen die Raketen seinen Rumpf."

2234, "Kommen wir zu der hitzesuchenden Rockeye-Rakete. Machen Sie die Rockeye mit Ihrer Sekundärwaffenauswahl scharf [drücken Sie $/$]."

2235, "Gut gemacht. Jetzt zielen Sie auf Drohne 02 [drücken Sie $h$]."

2236, "Sobald Sie eine Rockeye abfeuern, schaltet sich das Lenksystem der Rakete auf die Wärmesignatur Ihres Ziels auf. Doch bedenken Sie, dass der Lenkradius der Rockeye begrenzt ist, das Ziel sollte sich nah der Mitte Ihres HUD befinden."

2237, "Zerstören Sie Drohne 02 mit Ihren Rockeye-Raketen [drücken Sie die $spacebar$]."

2238, "Saubere Arbeit, Pilot. Verglichen mit der Tempest ist die Rockeye präziser und besitzt eine grössere Wirkungsreichweite. Dafür kann eine Myrmidon auch nicht mehr als 20 Rockeyes mitführen."

2239, "Sie können auch den Salvenmodus einschalten, um jeweils zwei Raketen abzufeuern [drücken Sie $Shift-/$]. Sie richten mehr Schaden an und erhöhen Ihre Chancen, das Ziel zu treffen, verbrauchen aber auch Ihren Raketenvorrat doppelt so schnell."

2240, "Wir schicken jetzt noch ein paar Drohnen los, damit Sie mit den Raketen üben können. Schalten Sie zwischen den beiden Werfern um, damit Sie sowohl für die Tempest wie für die Rockeye ein Gefühl entwickeln."

2241, "Wenn Ihnen die Raketen ausgehen, müssen Sie Ihren Jäger aufmunitionieren. Dazu rufen Sie ein Versorgungsschiff herbei."

2242, "Als Erstes drücken Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Mitteilungsfenster aufzurufen, und dann die Taste [5] zum Munitionfassen."

2243, "Damit das Versorgungsschiff andocken kann, müssen Sie Ihren Jäger zum Stillstand bringen. Das Versorgungsschiff dockt dann automatisch an."

2244, "Im unteren Teil Ihres HUD wird die geschätzte Ankunftszeit des Versorgungsschiffes angezeigt."

2245, "Ein Versorgungsschiff hat zwei Einsatzzwecke. Erstens lädt es Ihre Sekundärwaffen und Täuschkörper wieder auf."

2246, "Zweitens ist ein Versorgungsschiff in der Lage, kleinere Reparaturen an Ihrem Schiff vor Ort vorzunehmen. Es kann jedes beschädigte oder zerstörte Subsystem reparieren. Allerdings kann es gegen Rumpfschäden auch nichts unternehmen."

2247, "Denken Sie daran, dass ein Versorgungsschiff nur so viele Waffen aufladen kann, wie seine Munitionsvorräte erlauben. Eventuell hat es nicht genug Munition für alle Ihre Jäger an Bord."

2248, "Wir haben in diesem Modul eine Menge Stoff behandelt. Wenn Sie sich das Ganze noch einmal ansehen wollen, starten Sie die Simulation neu. Ansonsten sind Sie jetzt qualifiziert, mit dem Modul TSM-103a weiterzumachen. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb."

2249, "TSM-103b wurde abgebrochen, da Sie sich nicht an Ihre Befehle gehalten haben. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb."

2280, "Erfassen Sie zunächst meinen Jäger als Ziel. Sie können dafür entweder die allgemeine Zielkontrolle benutzen [drücken Sie $t$] oder die Verbündeten-Zielkontrolle [drücken Sie dann $f$]."

2281, "Sie sehen, sobald ich mich bewege erscheint vor meinem Schiff eine runde Markierung. Das ist der Vorhaltekreis, der Ihnen zeigt, wohin Sie mit Ihrer Primärwaffe zielen müssen, um Ihr Ziel zu treffen."

2282, "Jetzt zielen Sie auf die Drohne. Sie können dafür entweder die allgemeine Zielkontrolle benutzen [drücken Sie $t$] oder die Feindzielsteuerung [drücken Sie dann $h$]."

2283, "Das Zielfenster unten links im HUD zeigt die Entfernung zu Ihrem Ziel sowie seinen Rumpfzustand an."

2284, "Der Rumpfzustand Ihres Ziels ist auch unten in Ihrer Zielvorrichtung abzulesen."

2285, "Sehen Sie, wie sich der Rumpfzustand der Drohne langsam verschlechtert, wenn ich auf sie schiesse."

2286, "Eine gute Taktik im Raumkampf ist es, Ihre Geschwindigkeit an die Ihres Ziels anzupassen. Üben Sie das jetzt mit der Drohne [drücken Sie $M$]."

2287, "Gut. Ihr Schub kann auf Wunsch auch automatisch an die Geschwindigkeit Ihres Ziels angepasst werden, selbst wenn sich die Ziele ändern. Benutzen Sie den Automatik-Umschalter, um diese Möglichkeit ein- oder auszuschalten [drücken Sie die Tastenkombination $Alt-m$]."

2288, "Gut. Während eines Gefechtes sollten Sie ständig in Bewegung bleiben."

2289, "Jetzt zerstören Sie die Drohne."

2290, "Vergessen Sie nicht, dass Sie auch Raketen haben [drücken Sie die $spacebar$]."

2291, "Zwei neue, unbewaffnete Drohnen sind angekommen. Zerstören Sie beide. Achten Sie darauf, Ihre Geschwindigkeit anzupassen [drücken Sie dazu $m$]."

2292, "Eine der leichtesten Möglichkeiten, neue Gegner als Ziel aufzuschalten, ist die automatische Erfassung [drücken Sie $Alt-h$]. Dadurch wird selbsttätig der nächstgelegene Gegner erfasst, sobald das momentane Ziel entweder zerstört wurde oder den Erfassungsbereich verlassen hat."

2293, "Diese Drohne ist bewaffnet. Sie wird in 10 Sekunden anfangen, auf Sie zu feuern. Zerstören Sie sie."

2294, "Sie werden von dieser Drohne ziemlich zusammengeschossen. Vielleicht sollten Sie die ersten beiden Trainingsmodule nochmal wiederholen."

2295, "Versuchen wir diese Übung nochmal. Hier kommen zwei weitere unbewaffnete Drohnen. Zerstören Sie sie."

2296, "Hier ist eine bewaffnete Drohne. Sie haben 10 Sekunden, bevor sie das Feuer eröffnet. Zerstören Sie sie."

2297, "Pilot, Sie sind in keinster Weise bereit für den Raumkampf. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Sprungantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden [drücken Sie die Tastenkombination $Alt-j$]."

2298, "Jetzt kommen wir zum lustigen Teil. Zehn bewaffnete Drohnen werden paarweise ankommen. Zerstören Sie so viele wie möglich."

2299, "Sieht aus, als hätten Sie erstmal genug. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Sprungantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden [drücken Sie die Tastenkombination $Alt-j$]."

2300, "Sie haben sich nicht an die Anweisungen gehalten, Pilot. Sie haben daher bei dieser Trainingssimulation versagt. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Sprungantrieb [drücken Sie $Alt-j$]."

2301, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Sie haben sich erfolgreich für den Myrmidon-Raumjäger qualifiziert. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb [drücken Sie die Tastenkombination $Alt-j$]."

2304, "Einsatzbeschreibung??"

2305, "Ein neues Geschwader

Willkommen bei den 107. Ravens, Pilot. Ich bin Leutnant Samsa, Ihr Geschwaderführer. Wie Sie wissen, ist die Aquitaine jetzt unterwegs zum Gamma-Draconis-System. Die genauen Details der Lage unterliegen der höchsten Geheimhaltungsstufe, daher tappe ich genauso im Dunkeln wie Sie. Der Admiral wird die Mannschaft einweisen, sobald wir das Hauptquartier der 3. Flotte in Capella erreicht haben."

2306, "Die 107. Ravens

Das 107. ist ein schweres Kampfgeschwader, daher fliegen wir am liebsten den Hercules Mark II. Dank seiner Fortschritte im Bereich des Fusionsantriebs erhöht der Mark II die Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit des Hercules-Jägers, ohne dafür an der Waffenzuladung zu sparen. Der Herc hat nur zwei Raketenlafetten, aber seine Zuladung ist trotzdem grösser als die des Myrmidon. Der ursprüngliche Herc hat den Grossen Krieg gewonnen, darum setzen wir seine Tradition mit Stolz fort."

2307, "Der Hercules II

Ich empfehle Ihnen, sich mit den Trainingsmodulen für den Herc II vertraut zu machen, bevor die Aquitaine in Capella ankommt. Diese Module behandeln fortgeschrittene Taktiken wie Gegenmassnahmen und Energietransfer. Der Herc II ist langsamer als der Myrmidon, den Sie beim 53. geflogen sind, daher sollten Sie lernen, wie man Raketen ausweicht und die Schilde anpasst. Mit diesen Fähigkeiten können Sie dann das Beste aus Ihrem Jäger herausholen. Üben Sie sie, denn vielleicht ist das nächste Leben, das Sie dadurch retten, Ihr eigenes."

2308, "Neue Waffen

Ihrer Dienstakte zufolge sind Sie am GTW-5a Prometheus R, an der GTM-19 Harpoon und der GTM-4 Hornet-Rakete ausgebildet. 
Das Prometheus R ist ein vereinfachter Nachbau eines Geschützes, das während des Grossen Krieges entwickelt worden ist. Nachdem die Allianz den Kontakt zur Erde verloren hat, fehlte uns das Material für die Massenproduktion, daher haben unsere Ingenieure eine einfachere Version entwickelt. Das Prometheus hat mehr Feuerkraft als der Standardlaser Subach HL-7, erschöpft dafür aber auch die Energiereserven viel schneller."

2309, "Neue Waffen

Die Harpoon und die Hornet sind beide zielsuchende Raketen. Die Harpoonwerfer feuern einzelne Raketen, während die Hornet als Schwarm von je vier Stück abgefeuert wird; acht, wenn Sie im Doppelfeuermodus sind. Die Trainingsmodule behandeln die korrekte Technik beim Abfeuern zielsuchender Raketen, Sie sollten sie also auf jeden Fall absolvieren. Das ist im Moment alles, Pilot. Die Aquitaine wird in vier Stunden in Capella eintreffen."

2310, "Willkommen zum Trainingssimulationsmodul TSM-107m zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den schweren Raumjäger Hercules II. Dieses Modul wurde entworfen, um Piloten erste Kenntnisse über Kommunikationssysteme, Täuschkörper und zielsuchende Raketen zu vermitteln."

2311, "Gut gemacht, Pilot. Damit beenden Sie erfolgreich das Modul TSM-107m zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den schweren Raumjäger Hercules II. Sie sollten nun mit dem Trainingssimulator-Modul TSM-107se fortfahren, das sich mit der Handhabung der Schilde und dem Energietransfersystem befasst."

2312, "Ihre Leistung entsprach nicht den Anforderungen für Modul TSM-107m zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den schweren Raumjäger Hercules II. Sie erhalten keinen Zugang zum nächsten Ausbildungsmodul, solange Sie dieses Modul nicht erfolgreich abgeschlossen haben."

2331, "Beginnen wir mit der Kommunikation."

2332, "Bei der Klasse-A-Qualifikation haben Sie gelernt, wie man ein Versorgungsschiff zum Aufmunitionieren und zur Reparatur der Subsysteme herbeiruft. Jetzt werden wir Ihnen zeigen, wie Sie den Piloten unter Ihrem Kommando Befehle erteilen können."

2333, "Unser Ziel für diese Simulation ist ein Transporter der Argo-Klasse."

2334, "Zielen Sie auf den Transporter. Benutzen Sie ihre Feindzielsteuerung. Drücken sie [$h$]."

2335, "Gut. Jetzt rufen Sie die Verstärkung herbei. Drücken Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Mitteilungsfenster zu öffnen. Wählen Sie die Verstärkung, drücken sie dazu [4], dann die Staffel, die Sie anfordern wollen. Die Epsilon-Staffel ist hier Ihre einzige Wahl, also drücken Sie [1]."

2336, "Überprüfen Sie, dass Sie noch immer den Transporter als Ziel erfasst haben. Drücken sie Taste [$h$]."

2337, "Jetzt lassen Sie den Transporter durch die Epsilon-Staffel zerstören. Drücken Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Mitteilungsfenster wieder zu öffnen."

2338, "Wählen Sie Taste [2], um Befehle an eine bestimmte Staffel zu senden. Drücken Sie dann [1], um die Epsilon-Staffel auszuwählen. Sie schicken jetzt Ihre Befehle ausschliesslich an diese Staffel."

2339, "Jetzt drücken Sie die Taste [1], und Epsilon zerstört Ihr Ziel."

2340, "Gut gemacht, Pilot! Versuchen wir das gleich nochmal."

2341, "Befehlen Sie der Epsilon-Staffel, den Transporter 02 zu vernichten. Erinnern Sie sich noch an die Anleitung von vorhin? Wenn nicht, schlagen Sie in der Befehlsliste nach."

2342, "Gute Arbeit. Denken Sie immer daran, dass Jäger-Staffeln gegen grosse Ziele weniger wirksam sind. Um ein Kriegsschiff zu zerstören, das grösser als ein Kreuzer ist, sind in der Regel Bomber oder Kampfschiffe mit Strahl-Geschütztürmen nötig."

2343, "Bedenken Sie auch, dass Verstärkungen nicht immer verfügbar sind, und dass Sie nur die Befehlsgewalt über bestimmte Staffeln und Schiffe haben."

2344, "Befehlen Sie jetzt der Epsilon-Staffel, abzufliegen."

2345, "Drücken Sie die Kommunikationstaste [$c$], um das Mitteilungsfenster zu öffnen. Wählen Sie Taste [2] für die Staffeln, dann Taste [1] für Epsilon. Schliesslich drücken Sie Taste [0] für den Abflugbefehl."

2346, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Je erfahrener Sie im Raumkampf werden, desto selbstverständlicher werden Sie mit der Kommunikationssteuerung umgehen."

2347, "In Ordnung, Pilot. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, dass Sie etwas über Täuschkörper lernen."

2348, "Wenn Sie einen Täuschkörper abschiessen, bieten Sie einer Rakete, die Sie verfolgt, ein neues Ziel an. Theoretisch zumindest soll die Rakete den Täuschkörper treffen, statt ein Loch in Ihren Rumpf zu sprengen."

2349, "Sie werden Täuschkörper einsetzen müssen, um im Gefecht zu überleben, aber Sie werden auch schon bald merken, dass diese Taktik in der Praxis nicht immer funktioniert."

2350, "Für diese Übung holen wir uns einen Kreuzer der Leviathan-Klasse."

2351, "Der Kreuzer feuert jetzt Raketen auf Sie ab. Drücken Sie die Täuschkörper-Taste [$x$], um den Raketen zu entkommen."

2352, "Erhöhen Sie sofort Ihre Geschwindigkeit auf das Maximum und entfernen Sie sich von den verfolgenden Raketen. Geben Sie volle Leistung auf die Nachbrenner. Drücken sie [$Tab$], um den nötigen Extraschub zu bekommen."

2353, "Ein gelbes Dreieck erscheint auf Ihrem HUD, das den Vektor der anfliegenden Rakete markiert. Versuchen Sie, diese Markierung immer in der 3- oder 9-Uhr-Position zu halten."

2354, "Wenn die Rakete Sie fast erreicht hat, zünden Sie den Täuschkörper. Hören Sie auf das Piepsen der Raketenerfassung, das die Entfernung der Rakete anzeigt. Je schneller die Töne, desto näher die Rakete."

2355, "Während Sie Täuschkörper einsetzen, wenden Sie Ihren Jäger schnell in harten, ruckartigen Bewegungen. Auch das kann helfen, die Rakete abzuschütteln."

2356, "Wenn Sie es schaffen, die Rakete abzuschütteln, erscheint eine Markierung oben in Ihrer Zielvorrichtung. Das ist für Sie das Zeichen, dass Ihre Bemühungen erfolgreich waren."

2357, "Die verbleibende Anzahl der Täuschkörper erkennen Sie in Ihrem HUD unter der Waffenanzeige. Wenn Ihnen die Täuschkörper ausgehen, rufen Sie ein Versorgungsschiff herbei."

2358, "Diese Raketen haben Ihnen schweren Schaden zugefügt. Wir raten Ihnen, Modul TSM-107m zu wiederholen. Ihre Überlebenschancen da draussen sind minimal, wenn Sie Täuschkörper nicht effektiv einsetzen können."

2359, "Jetzt sind wir lange genug Raketen ausgewichen. Üben wir mal, selber welche abzufeuern."

2360, "Ihr Schwerer Angriffsjäger Hercules II ist mit zwei Harpoon-Werfern bewaffnet."

2361, "Anders als bei wärmesuchenden Raketen wie der Rockeye müssen Sie bei einer zielsuchenden Waffe erst ein Ziel erfassen, damit sie trifft."

2362, "Dennoch ist die zielsuchende Rakete diesen zusätzlichen Aufwand wert, da sie entschieden häufiger trifft."

2363, "Wenn ein Wärmesucher sein Ziel verliert, ist es gut möglich, dass er kein neues mehr erfasst. Eine zielsuchende Rakete hingegen verfolgt ihr Ziel bis zur Detonation."

2364, "Transporter 03 fliegt jetzt ein. Nutzen wir diese Gelegenheit, um eine weitere Zielkontrolle kennenzulernen."

2365, "Sie haben eine Fadenkreuz-Zielkontrolle (Taste [$y$]), die das nächstgelegene Objekt in Ihrer Zielvorrichtung erfasst. Manövrieren Sie Ihren Jäger so, dass mein Schiff in der Mitte Ihres HUDs erscheint."

2366, "Gut. Jetzt benutzen Sie die Fadenkreuz-Zielkontrolle [$y$], um meinen Jäger zu erfassen."

2367, "Gut gemacht. Erfassen Sie jetzt Transporter 03 mit der Fadenkreuz-Zielkontrolle. Drücken Sie dazu [$y$]. Vergewissern Sie sich, dass der Transporter in der Mitte Ihres HUDs erscheint."

2368, "Ausgezeichnet. Jetzt wollen wir doch mal sehen, wie Sie mit den Harpoons umgehen können."

2369, "Beachten Sie das rote Dreieck, das sich auf Ihr Ziel zubewegt. Das ist Ihre Aufschaltmarkierung. Sobald sie bis ins Ziel gewandert ist, sehen Sie die 'Ziel erfasst'-Markierung. Das bedeutet, dass Ihre Harpoons das Ziel aufgeschaltet haben und feuerbereit sind."

2370, "Feuern Sie jetzt eine Harpoon auf den Frachter ab."

2371, "Beachten Sie, wie schnell die Harpoon ist. Diese Rakete ist eine gefährliche Waffe."

2372, "Sie können alle drei Sekunden eine Harpoonsalve abfeuern. Schiessen Sie noch einmal, und beachten Sie dann den Countdown-Zähler in Ihrer Waffenanzeige."

2373, "Eine Harpoon, die vor einer Zielerfassung abgefeuert wird, ist so gut wie nutzlos. Das ist ein wichtiger Unterschied zwischen der Harpoon und der Rockeye."

2374, "Feuern Sie jetzt weiter mit den Harpoons, bis Transporter 03 zerstört ist."

2375, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit. Mal sehen, wie gut Sie gegen bewegliche Ziele sind."

2376, "Um ein bewegliches Ziel zu erfassen, müssen Sie es in Ihrer HUD-Zielvorrichtung halten."

2377, "Wir schicken jetzt ein paar Jäger-Drohnen los. Sobald die erste Drohne erscheint, erfassen Sie sie und schalten Sie sie als Ziel auf. Versuchen Sie, das Ziel in der Mitte Ihrer HUD-Zielvorrichtung zu halten."

2378, "Sobald das Ziel aufgeschaltet ist, feuern Sie eine Harpoon ab, um diese Drohne zu vernichten. Diese Drohnen setzen keine Täuschkörper ein."

2379, "Gut gemacht. Alle zielsuchenden Raketen funktionieren auf die gleiche Weise, von der Hornet-Rakete bis zum Helios-Torpedo. Generell kann man sagen, je grösser und stärker ein Gefechtskopf, desto länger dauert die Zielerfassung und die Nachladezeit zwischen den Schüssen."

2380, "Dann wollen wir Sie mal vor eine echte Herausforderung stellen. Mehrere Staffeln werden gleichzeitig erscheinen. Zerstören Sie sie alle."

2381, "Sie müssen in Schussentfernung zum Ziel sein, bevor eine Zielerfassung möglich ist. Benutzen Sie die Nachbrenner, um die Drohnen abzufangen."

2382, "Ihre Raketenwerfer sind fast leer. Rufen Sie ein Versorgungsschiff her zum Aufmunitionieren [drücken Sie $Shift-R$]."

2383, "Gut gemacht. Damit wäre das TSM-107m abgeschlossen. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden."

2384, "Sie haben sich nicht an die Anweisungen gehalten, Pilot. Sie haben daher bei Modul TSM-107m versagt. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden. Drücken Sie [$Alt-J$]."

2385, "Training 5"

2386, "Willkommen zum Trainingssimulationsmodul TSM-107se zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den schweren Raumjäger Hercules II. Dieses Modul wurde entworfen, um Piloten erste Kenntnisse über die Handhabung der Schilde und das Energietransfersystem zu vermitteln."

2387, "Herzlichen Glückwunsch. Damit beenden Sie erfolgreich das Modul TSM-107se zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den schweren Raumjäger Hercules II."

2388, "Ihre Leistung entsprach nicht den Anforderungen für Modul TSM-107se zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den schweren Raumjäger Hercules II. Sie erhalten keine Genehmigung für höhere Ausbildungsmodule, solange Sie dieses Modul nicht erfolgreich abgeschlossen haben."

2389, "Schilde ausgleichen"

2390, "Drücken Sie [$q$]"

2400, "Erhöhen Sie die Antriebsenergie"

2401, "Drücken Sie [$page up$]"

2402, "Simulation verlassen"

2403, "Willkommen bei Modul TSM-107se, Pilot. Bitte betätigen Sie die Steuerung erst, wenn ich es Ihnen sage. Sie werden durchfallen, wenn Sie sich nicht genau an meine Anweisungen halten."

2404, "Als Erstes schauen wir uns mal die Anzeigen und Regler für Ihr Schildsystem an."

2405, "Die Allianz erbeutete die Schildtechnologie während des Grossen Krieges von den Shivanern. Schildsysteme gehören seit über dreissig Jahren zur Standardausrüstung von terranisch-vasudanischen Jägern und Bombern."

2406, "Ihre Schildgeneratoren erzeugen eine Energiehülle um das Schiff herum, die Ihren Rumpf vor Primärfeuer und Raketen schützt."

2407, "Durch die Absorption schädlicher Energie werden die Schilde geschwächt. Doch im Laufe der Zeit regeneriert Ihr Jäger seine Schilde automatisch."

2408, "Ihre Schildanzeige befindet sich unten rechts in Ihrem HUD."

2409, "Ihr Schild ist in vier Quadranten aufgeteilt. Jeder Quadrant verträgt nur eine gewisse Menge an Schaden."

2410, "Wenn ein Schildquadrant beschädigt wird, blitzt die entsprechende Sektion Ihrer Schildanzeige auf. Schauen Sie hin."

2411, "Die Vorderpartie Ihres Schildes blinkt jetzt auf, als hätten Sie dort einen Treffer erhalten."

2412, "Beachten Sie, wie sich die Anzeige verändert, wenn Ihr Schild öfters getroffen wird. Wenn ein Schildquadrant völlig zerstört worden ist, schlagen alle weiteren Treffer dort direkt auf dem Rumpf Ihres Jägers ein."

2413, "Ihre Schilde erholen sich automatisch. Beschleunigen wir den Vorgang etwas, um Zeit zu sparen."

2414, "Beobachten Sie, wie der vordere Quadrant Ihres Schildes sich wieder zu voller Stärke regeneriert."

2415, "Ihr Schild ist jetzt wieder voll aufgeladen."

2416, "Ein effektiver Umgang mit den Schilden kann den Unterschied zwischen Leben und Tod ausmachen."

2417, "Der einfachste Weg, Ihre Schilde zu verwalten, ist der Quadrantenausgleich."

2418, "Ich habe Ihren Vorderquadranten wieder beschädigt. Reparieren Sie Ihre Schilde jetzt mit dem Quadrantenausgleich. [Drücken Sie $q$]"

2419, "Gut gemacht. Sie sehen, Ihre Vorderpartie ist grösstenteils wieder aufgeladen. Diese Schildenergie kam aus Ihren anderen drei Quadranten."

2420, "Üben Sie diese Funktion oft und reichlich."

2421, "Ich schwäche jetzt die meisten Ihrer Schilde. In drei Ihrer vier Quadranten ist die Energie jetzt nahe Null."

2422, "Mit Ihrer Schildsteuerung können Sie die Schildstärke in jeden einzelnen Quadranten auf Maximum bringen."

2423, "Als Erstes maximieren Sie die Schildstärke des Frontquadranten [drücken Sie mehrmals $Up Arrow$]."

2424, "Gut gemacht. Jetzt ist Ihr vorderer Quadrant auf voller Leistung, während alle anderen Quadranten geschwächt sind."

2425, "Ihren vorderen Schilden maximale Leistung zukommen zu lassen ist besonders wichtig, wenn Sie etwa den Geschützturm eines Grosskampfschiffes angreifen."

2426, "Jetzt maximieren Sie bitte die Schildstärke des Heckquadranten [drücken Sie mehrmals $Down Arrow$]."

2427, "Wenn Sie auf ein wichtiges Ziel zufliegen und von Verfolgern angegriffen werden, ist eine Verstärkung des hinteren Schildquadranten oft lebenswichtig."

2428, "Jetzt benutzen Sie wieder den Quadrantenausgleich, um die Schildenergie gleichmässig um Ihr Schiff herum zu verteilen [$q$]."

2429, "Wir schliessen dieses Modul ab mit einem Überblick über Ihr Energie-Transfersystem (ETS)."

2430, "Sie können das ETS benutzen, um die Energieversorgung der drei Hauptsysteme zu steuern."

2431, "Als Erstes versorgen wir mal Ihre Waffen bevorzugt mit Energie [drücken Sie viermal $insert$]. Sie sehen, dass die Energielevel für Schilde und Antrieb fallen, wenn Sie mehr Energie zu den Waffen umleiten."

2432, "Je mehr Energie Sie den Waffen zukommen lassen, desto schneller laden sich Ihre Primärwaffen wieder auf. Allerdings richten die Schüsse dadurch keinen grösseren Schaden an."

2433, "Hochenergiegeschütze wie die Prometheus erschöpfen Ihre Waffenenergie sehr schnell. Wenn Sie schnell feuern müssen, kann eine Umleitung der Energie zu den Waffen von Vorteil sein."

2434, "Jetzt vergrössern wir mal die Zuteilung für die Schilde [drücken Sie dreimal $home$]."

2435, "Je höher die Energie-Einstellung für die Schilde, desto schneller laden sie sich wieder auf. Das kann in bestimmten Kampfsituationen lebensnotwendig sein, etwa beim Aufmunitionieren Ihres Jägers oder beim Durchbruch durch schwere Flakzonen."

2436, "Jetzt leiten Sie mehr Energie zum Antrieb um [drücken Sie zweimal $page up$]."

2437, "Maximale Energie für den Antrieb erhöht Ihre Höchstgeschwindigkeit um bis zu 30%, je nach Reaktorkapazität des Jägers. Ihre Nachbrenner laden sich ebenfalls schneller wieder auf, so dass Sie öfters Extraschub geben können."

2438, "Bei einem langsameren Jäger wie dem Hercules Mark II kann die Umleitung der Energie zum Antrieb notwendig sein, damit er wendigere Gegner bekämpfen oder schnell grössere Entfernungen überbrücken kann."

2439, "Gut gemacht. Damit wäre das Modul TSM-107se abgeschlossen. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden."

2440, "Sie haben sich nicht an die Anweisungen gehalten. Daher wird das Modul TSM-107se als Fehlschlag gewertet. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden [$Alt-J$]."

2441, "Unten rechts in Ihrem HUD sehen Sie drei Anzeigen: G steht für die Geschütze, S für die Schilde und A für den Antrieb."

2442, "Training 6"

2443, "Willkommen!

Lieutenant Commander Cordova hier. Willkommen bei den 242. Suicide Kings, Pilot. Ich habe aus inoffiziellen Quellen erfahren, dass die Rebellen im Epsilon-Pegasi-System einen Überraschungsangriff gestartet haben. Genaueres kann ich zur Zeit noch nicht in Erfahrung bringen, alles unterliegt der Sicherheitsstufe Phi, und das Oberkommando hat es nicht sonderlich eilig, uns auf dem Laufenden zu halten. Petrarch sagt, er will die Aquitaine informieren, sobald wir Capella erreichen."

2444, "Die 242. Suicide Kings

Die GTA hat die Suicide Kings während des Grossen Krieges gegründet, als der alte Valkyrie-Jäger in Dienst gestellt wurde, nach dem shivanischen Angriff auf Ross 128. Das 242. war damals auf der Galatea stationiert, und unser erster Auftrag war die Gefangennahme von Leutnant Alexander McCarthy. Wir alle haben den McCarthy-Prozess in der Schule verfolgt, Pilot. Wir sind hier ein Teil der Geschichte, auch wenn die Galatea seit langem verschwunden ist und die Valkyries längst verschrottet worden sind."

2445, "Der Perseus-Abfangjäger
Der Perseus ist ein Abfangjäger der neuesten Generation, der schnellste Jäger der GTVA. Unsere Hauptaufgabe im Gefecht ist es, Bomber anzugreifen und Raketen abzufangen. Wir werden aber auch gerne für Präzisionsangriffe auf grössere Kriegsschiffe eingesetzt. Man nennt uns nicht umsonst die Suicide Kings, die Könige des Selbstmordes. Wir verdienen uns diesen Spitznamen bei jedem Einsatz von neuem. Ich empfehle Ihnen daher dringend, die Trainingsmodule für den Perseus schnellstens zu absolvieren. Sie werden dort lernen, wie man Bomben und Geschütztürme anvisiert, und alles andere, was man in einem Abfanggeschwader so können muss."

2446, "Die Stiletto II

Sie haben jetzt die Erlaubnis, die GTM-43a Stiletto-II-Rakete einzusetzen, die speziell zum Ausschalten von Subsystemen entwickelt wurde. Die 43a weist gegenüber der Original-Stiletto ein verbessertes Lenksystem und eine Disruptorladung auf. Auch der Antrieb wurde überarbeitet, die neue Version ist schneller und hat eine grössere Reichweite."

2447, "Willkommen zum Trainingssimulationsmodul TSM-122x zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den Abfangjäger Perseus. Dieses Modul wurde entworfen, um Piloten Kenntnisse über den Bomben-Zielabwurf, über Geschütztürme und Subsysteme zu vermitteln."

2448, "Gut gemacht, Pilot. Damit beenden Sie erfolgreich das Modul TSM-122x zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den Abfangjäger Perseus. Viel Glück bei Ihrem nächsten Einsatz."

2449, "Ihre Leistung entsprach nicht den Anforderungen für Modul TSM-122x zur fortgeschrittenen Qualifikation für den Abfangjäger Perseus. Wir empfehlen Ihnen, dieses Modul zu wiederholen, bis Sie es erfolgreich abgeschlossen haben."

2450, "Zielen Sie auf die Deimos"

2464, "Zerstören Sie die Geschütztürme"

2465, "Sensoren als Ziel erfassen"

2466, "Zerstören Sie die Sensoren"

2467, "Willkommen beim Modul TSM-122x, Pilot. Bitte betätigen Sie die Steuerung erst, wenn ich es Ihnen sage. Sie werden durchfallen, wenn Sie sich nicht genau an meine Anweisungen halten."

2468, "Die wichtigste Rolle des Perseus-Abfangjägers ist die Vernichtung gegnerischer Bomber und ihrer Raketen."

2469, "Für diese Übung brauchen wir ein Ziel. Holen wir uns eine Korvette der Deimos-Klasse."

2470, "Erinnern Sie sich noch an die Geleitschutzliste? Sie wird auf der rechten Seite Ihres HUD angezeigt. Benutzen Sie die Geleitschutz-Zielkontrolle, um die Deimos auszuwählen [$e$]."

2471, "Gut. Jetzt wollen wir mal etwas Spannung reinbringen. Da kommt eine Staffel shivanischer Seraphim-Bomber."

2472, "Keine Bange, das ist nur ein Übungssimulator. Beobachten Sie erstmal nur, was vor sich geht."

2473, "Sobald sich die Seraphim-Bomber der Deimos nähern, werfen sie ihre Bomben ab."

2474, "Benutzen Sie die Bomben-Zielkontrolle [$b$], um die shivanischen Gefechtsköpfe zu erfassen. Wenn keine Gefechtsköpfe unterwegs sind, erfasst diese Kontrolle den nächstgelegenen Bomber."

2475, "Die Bombe erscheint in Ihrer Zielansicht, bis sie detoniert. Wenn die Bombe den Rumpf der Deimos trifft, flackert deren Name auf Ihrem Geleitschutzmonitor auf. So wissen Sie immer, wann ein Schiff aus Ihrer Geleitschutzliste Treffer einstecken muss."

2476, "Bomben erscheinen auch als bernsteinfarbene Punkte auf dem Radar."

2477, "Sehen wir uns noch eine weitere Zielkontrolle an. Die Ziel-Angreiferkontrolle [$g$] ermöglicht Ihnen, gegnerische Schiffe direkt zu erfassen, die Ihr Ziel angreifen. Besonders bei Verteidigungs- oder Geleitschutzeinsätzen ist diese Kontrolle sehr praktisch."

2478, "Als Erstes wählen Sie das Schiff aus, das Sie beschützen sollen. Blättern Sie dazu die verbündeten Ziele durch [$f$] oder benutzen Sie die Geleitschutz-Zielkontrolle [$e$]."

2479, "Sehr gut. Jetzt benutzen Sie die Ziel-Angreiferkontrolle [$g$], um das nächstgelegene gegnerische Schiff zu finden, das Ihr derzeitiges Ziel angreift. Das wäre die Seraphim."

2480, "Jetzt wollen wir mal sehen, wie gut Sie das in einer Kampfsituation beherrschen. Damit die Sache fair bleibt, geben wir der Deimos wieder ihre volle Stärke."

2481, "Bevor wir die Bomber loslassen, hier noch ein paar Hinweise."

2482, "Als Erstes orten Sie die Bombe, mit den Sensoren oder auf Sicht. Sie können die Bomben besser vernichten, wenn Sie auf Sicht arbeiten können, aber ab und zu werden Sie mangels Orientierung die Bomben-Zielkontrolle benutzen müssen [$b$]."

2483, "Man braucht nur ein oder zwei Treffer, um eine Bombe abzuschiessen, und die meisten Gefechtsköpfe sind langsamer als Ihr Abfangjäger. Aber gehen Sie nicht zu dicht ran. Die Schockwelle könnte Ihren Rumpf beschädigen oder ein paar Subsysteme ausfallen lassen."

2484, "Die beste Taktik ist natürlich, die Bomber zu vernichten, bevor sie ihre Ladung abwerfen können. Ein Abfangjäger ist auf Geschwindigkeit getrimmt, damit Sie mehrere Angriffswellen von Bombern im gesamten Kampfgebiet abwehren können."

2485, "Sie haben die Deimos verloren, Pilot. Es ist schwierig, aber nicht unmöglich. Wir werden diese Simulation jetzt abbrechen, damit Sie von vorne beginnen und es noch mal versuchen können."

2486, "Ausgezeichnete Arbeit, Pilot. Sie haben die Bomber abgewehrt und die Deimos beschützt."

2487, "Noch ein Tip. Mit Hilfe des Mitteilungsfensters können Sie Ihre Staffelkameraden anweisen, ein Ziel zu beschützen. Piloten mit diesem Befehl helfen Ihnen, Bomben abzufangen, die auf ihr schutzbefohlenes Ziel abgefeuert werden. Bomben zu jagen ist viel leichter, wenn man als Team zusammenarbeitet."

2488, "Ihre Raketenwerfer sind leer, Pilot. Rufen Sie ein Versorgungsschiff her zum Aufmunitionieren [drücken Sie $Shift-R$]."

2489, "Für die nächste Phase dieser Simulation wollen wir die Deimos wieder auf volle Stärke bringen. Ausserdem verändern wir ihre IFF-Kennung von 'verbündet' auf 'feindlich'."

2490, "Zielen Sie auf die Korvette. Benutzen Sie dazu Ihre Feindzielsteuerung [Drücken Sie $h$]."

2491, "Gut. Als Jäger haben Sie nur eine minimale Chance, grosse Kriegsschiffe alleine zu vernichten. Bomben und Strahlkanonen sind da viel effektiver, aber diese Waffen sind zu gross, um in einem Jäger eingebaut zu werden."

2492, "Doch die Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit des Jägers macht ihn zum idealen Instrument für chirurgische Angriffe auf die Geschütztürme und Subsysteme grosser Kampfschiffe."

2493, "Benutzen Sie die Geschützturm-Zielkontrolle [$k$], um die Geschütztürme des Schiffes durchzugehen. Sie werden sehen, dass die Korvette eine Reihe verschiedener Waffenarten hat, von Strahlwaffen über Laser- und Flakgeschütze bis hin zu Raketenwerfern."

2494, "Sie sehen, dass der Geschützturm mit einem Rahmen markiert ist. Die Zielansicht zeigt die Waffenart des Geschützturms und seinen momentanen Zustand an. Wenn das als Ziel erfasste Objekt gerade nicht im Blickfeld ist, wird es mit einer Raute angezeigt."

2495, "Jetzt erfassen Sie die Raketenwerfer der Deimos und zerstören Sie sie."

2496, "Ausgezeichnet. Sobald Sie einen Geschützturm vernichtet haben, erfassen Ihre Sensoren automatisch den nächsten Geschützturm als Ziel."

2497, "Grössere Kriegsschiffe haben Dutzende von Waffensystemen, und in einer Gefechtssituation haben Sie wahrscheinlich nicht die Zeit, alle Geschütztürme durchzugehen, bis Sie den gefunden haben, der gerade auf Sie schiesst."

2498, "Sie haben eine Angreifer-Zielkontrolle [$r$], die den nächstgelegenen Gegner erfasst, der auf Sie schiesst. Wenn der Angreifer ein Kriegsschiff ist, wird der Geschützturm als Ziel erfasst, der auf Sie feuert."

2499, "Mit dieser Steuerung können Sie die Gegner zuerst erfassen, die für Ihren Jäger die grösste Gefahr darstellen."

2500, "Versuchen wir das jetzt mal. Die Deimos beginnt gleich, mit einem oder mehreren Geschütztürmen auf Sie zu feuern."

2501, "Benutzen Sie die Angreifer-Zielkontrolle [$r$], um den Geschützturm herauszufinden, der auf Sie feuert."

2502, "Zerstören Sie jetzt den Geschützturm. Benutzen Sie Geschütze oder Raketen, ganz wie Sie wollen. Sowohl wärme- als auch zielsuchende Raketen können gegen Subsysteme eingesetzt werden, sobald sie ein Ziel erfasst haben."

2503, "Gut. Jetzt schauen wir mal, wie Sie sich gegen mehrere Geschütztürme behaupten können."

2504, "Gute Arbeit, Pilot."

2505, "Sieht aus, als hätten Sie genug abbekommen. Nähern Sie sich auf dem Schlachtfeld einem Kriegsschiff nur mit äusserster Vorsicht. Bleiben Sie mit einem leichten Schiff wie der Perseus jederzeit in Bewegung. Zerstören Sie einen Geschützturm in zwei oder auch drei Zielanflügen, wenn es sein muss."

2506, "Beenden wir diese Lektion mit einem Blick auf die Zielerfassung bestimmter Subsysteme."

2507, "Indem Sie die Taste für die Subsystem-Zielkontrolle [$s$] wiederholt drücken, können Sie die einzelnen Subsysteme Ihres Ziels durchgehen."

2508, "Ein Subsystem erscheint auf Ihrem HUD in einem grossen Rahmen. Wenn das als Ziel erfasste Subsystem gerade nicht im Blickfeld ist, wird es mit einer Raute angezeigt."

2509, "Zielen Sie jetzt auf die Sensoren der Korvette [drücken Sie $s$]."

2510, "Gut gemacht. Wählen Sie jetzt das Akheton Subsystem-Disruptor-Geschütz, kurz SDG genannt, als Primärwaffe an [$.$]."

2511, "Das Akheton SDG ist eine Energiewaffe, die von den Vasudanern erfunden worden ist. Das Akheton zerstört die Subsysteme eines Ziels, richtet dabei aber nur minimale Schäden an seinem Rumpf an."

2512, "Zerstören Sie mit dem Akheton SDG die Sensoren der Korvette Deimos."

2513, "Gut. beachten Sie, dass Sie auch Ihren Teamkameraden befehlen können, die Subsysteme Ihres Ziels zu zerstören. Im Mitteilungsfenster wählen Sie den Befehl 'Lahmlegen', um den Antrieb ausschalten zu lassen. Mit dem Befehl 'Entwaffnen' weisen Sie Ihre Piloten an, die Waffen-Subsysteme Ihres Ziels zu vernichten."

2514, "Gut gemacht. Damit endet das Modul TSM-122x. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden."

2515, "Sie haben sich nicht an die Anweisungen gehalten. Daher wird das Modul TSM-122x als Fehlschlag gewertet. Aktivieren Sie Ihren Subraumantrieb, um diese Simulation zu beenden [$Alt-J$]."

2516, "Jetzt fangen Sie die Seraphim-Bomber ab und vernichten Sie sie, bevor sie die Korvette ausschalten können."

Bei höchstmöglicher Abschirmung und Waffenbestückung (und trotzdem noch ausreichend manövrierfähig, um als taktische Einheit zu gelten) verspricht der Boanerges, auch während der zukünftigen Dekaden im Dienst zu bleiben.

Aber sie explodierte sehr hübsch. Diese Drohnen werden nicht mehr hergestellt, aber ihre virtuellen Gegenstücke findet man in den Modulen der Trainingssimulatoren. Modell IV ist jeweils der erste Gegner eines Kampfpiloten, der erste bewegliche Feind, dem er während der Simulatorausbildung begegnet. Wenn Sie eine Amazon während des Trainings nicht erledigen können, ist es Zeit, sich zu überlegen, ob Sie nicht eine andere Laufbahn einschlagen sollten."

Modell VII wird dazu eingesetzt, Angriffe auf feindliche Hauptschiffe zu simulieren und Jäger- und Bomberpiloten darauf zu schulen, die Geschütztürme und Subsysteme der Schiffe zu treffen. Das Oberkommando hat herausgefunden, dass die Überlebensrate der Piloten beim Angriff auf grosse Schiffe nach dem virtuellen Training gegen Modell VII um 37% höher liegt."

3037, "Die GTS Hygeia ist das neueste terranische Versorgungsschiff der Flotte. Sie ist schnell und wendig - unerlässlich, wenn sie in der Hitze des Gefechts an Jäger andocken muss.

Die Reparatureinrichtungen der Hygeia arbeiten mit Künstlicher Intelligenz im neuralen Netzwerk und garantieren ultraschnelle Systemdiagnose und -reparatur. Die grosse Anzahl von Gefechtsköpfen, die die Hygeia mit sich führt, macht das Schiff allerdings auch gefährlich - man sollte sich nicht in der Nähe befinden, wenn es explodiert."

3038, "Die GTFr Triton kann beinahe die doppelte Tonnage aufnehmen wie die Frachter der Poseidon-Klasse, die der Allianz seit dem Grossen Krieg dienten. Die Möglichkeit, Vorräte und Munition in einem beliebigen Operationsgebiet abzuliefern, ist lebenswichtig. Mit der Triton können Kampfverbände ihre Streitkräfte gut ausrüsten, auch wenn sie über mehrere Systeme verteilt sind. Die Triton ist nicht nur in der Lage, an Raumstationen und TAC-Container anzudocken und Ladung aufzunehmen, sondern verfügt auch über einen eigenen Frachtraum für den Transfer von Schiff zu Schiff. Das Oberkommando erwartet, dass die Triton die Abhängigkeit der GTVA von Depots im tiefen Raum verringert, weil diese leichter angreifbar sind und eher sabotiert werden."

3039, "TC-TRI Container werden von Triton Dynamics speziell dazu hergestellt, empfindliche Ersatzteile für TD-Schiffe aufzunehmen, damit diese im Einsatzgebiet repariert werden können. Sobald die Teile im Lager einer Reparatureinrichtung übernommen wurden, werden die Container von der GTVA wiederverwendet."

3040, "Der GTFr Poseidon ist die kleinere Ausgabe der zwei terranischen Standard-Militärfrachter. Auch wenn er nur halb soviel Fracht wie die Triton aufnehmen kann, wird der Poseidon viel öfter für gefährliche Missionen gewählt. Wegen seiner höheren Geschwindigkeit hat man damit eine bessere Überlebenschance an der Frontlinie - wie auch durch die Tatsache, dass er vier Waffentürme besitzt, verglichen mit den zwei des Triton. Wenn das Alliierte Oberkommando Vorräte und Munition losschickt, die unbedingt durchkommen sollen, wird gewöhnlich ein Poseidon für den Transport genommen."

3041, "Der TC 2 ist der Standard-Frachtcontainer der GTVA für den Transport im tiefen Raum. Seine dünne Aussenwand bewahrt innen die atmosphärischen Bedingungen nach terranischem Standard, solange sie nicht durch Waffenbeschuss oder Zusammenstoss beschädigt wird. TC 2 Container lassen sich billig herstellen und werden überall aktiv genutzt - ausser an den Frontlinien (wo die gepanzerten TAC-1-Container zum Einsatz kommen, falls vorhanden)."

3042, "Der TSC 2 Container ist gepanzert und bietet mehr Schutz für die darin befindliche Fracht als der TC 2. Durch die Panzerung wird die Aussenwand hauptsächlich gegen Zerbersten bei Zusammenstössen geschützt. Sie ist allerdings nicht dick genug, um gegnerischen Angriffen standzuhalten. Die TSC 2 werden in lebhaften Versorgungsdepots eingesetzt, wo Kollisionen zum ständigen Risiko gehören."

3043, "Der TAC 1 ist ein sehr gut gepanzerter terranischer Frachtcontainer. Er wird häufig dazu verwendet, empfindliche oder wertvolle Fracht aufzunehmen. Den TAC 1 findet man im Allgemeinen direkt an der Front, wo der Schutz vor gegnerischen Angriffen vorrangig berücksichtigt werden muss."

3044, "Der TTC 1 ist ein ziviler Frachtcontainer, der zu militärischen Zwecken verändert wurde. Es handelt sich dabei um einen Container mit besonders dichter Hülle, der ursprünglich dazu gedacht war, zerbrechliche technische und wissenschaftliche Ausrüstungen zu schützen. Dieser Schutz gegen Zusammenstösse oder Angriffe kommt jetzt auch Ersatz-Subsystemen und anderer Elektronik zugute, die für Kampfschiffe im Einsatz bestimmt sind."

3045, "Die GTC Fenris gehört zu den etwas in die Jahre gekommenen treuen Gefährten unter den Kriegsschiffen der Allianz. Vor dem Grossen Krieg waren die Fenris die einzigen Kreuzer unter terranischem Kommando. Während des Krieges beschloss das terranische Oberkommando, eine zweite Gattung Kreuzer zu bauen, die Leviathans, um die Fenris von Begleit- und Bewachungsaufgaben zu befreien. Fenris-Kreuzer kamen auf fast allen Kriegsschauplätzen zum Einsatz. Diese schnellen und vielseitigen Kreuzer sind mit ihrem 260 Meter langen Rumpf schlagkräftig genug, um mit jedem feindlichen Kreuzer den Nahkampf aufzunehmen. Wegen ihrer Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit sind die Fenris eine gute Wahl für Angriffseinsätze."

3046, "Die Terraner entwickelten den GTM Hippocrates in der frühen Wiederaufbauphase der Nachkriegszeit. Bei Ausbruch der NTF-Revolte wurde der Hippocrates von der GTVA wieder in den aktiven Militärdienst genommen. Die Einrichtungen an Bord bieten modernste medizinische Versorgung für Tausende von Patienten. Hippocrates helfen ausserdem dabei, Flüchtlinge aus den umkämpften Gebieten in von Alliierten kontrollierte Regionen in Sicherheit zu bringen. Der unübliche Aufbau des Hippocrates ermöglicht der Mannschaft, Bereiche des Schiffs schnell abzuriegeln, falls eine Quarantäne nötig ist oder es ein Leck im Rumpf gibt."

3047, "In der Anfangszeit des Grossen Krieges entwarfen und bauten die Ingenieure bei Han-Ronald die Serie der Leviathan-Kreuzer. Der Leviathan ist viel schwerer bewaffnet und gepanzert als die Fenris-Klasse, aber deshalb auch viel langsamer und weniger wendig. Leviathan-Kreuzer werden zum Schutz gefährdeter Einrichtungen verwendet - wie etwa permanenten Sprungknoten, Raumfabriken und Gasgewinnungseinrichtungen -, wo Feuerkraft von grösster Wichtigkeit und Geschwindigkeit eher nebensächlich ist. Sie sind ebenfalls gut geeignet, um langsame Frachter oder Transporter zu eskortieren. Die Fenris sind für schnelle Operationen gut, doch wenn es um Stärke und Ausdauer geht, dann nimmt man einen Leviathan."

3048, "Der GTSC Faustus ist in erster Linie ein ziviles Forschungsschiff. In Friedenszeiten dienen diese Schiffe den Wissenschaftlern vieler Fachrichtungen. Im Krieg wird ein Faustus jedoch vom Militär befehligt, vor allen Dingen zum Zweck der Waffenforschung. Auf einem Faustus-Schiff wurde während des Grossen Krieges die shivanische Schildtechnologie eines eroberten shivanischen Kampfschiffes erstmals rekonstruiert. Der Faustus ist nur spärlich gepanzert und besitzt nur ein paar armselige Verteidigungsaufbauten. Einem Faustus wird man nur in ganz hoffnungslosen Situationen in der Nähe der Frontlinie begegnen."

3049, "Wenn ein Kampfpilot ein Schiff der GTG Zephyrus-Klasse auftauchen sieht, wird ihm wahrscheinlich nur durch den Kopf gehen: 'Zum Glück muss ich diesen Kübel nicht fliegen!' Der Zephyrus dient der Gewinnung von Gas aus interstellaren Nebeln. Es handelt sich dabei um das grösste nicht-kämpfende Schiff der GTVA-Flotte. Durch die dünne Panzerung, seine schwache Bewaffnung und geringe Geschwindigkeit hat der Zephyrus in einem Kampf eine äusserst geringe Überlebenschance, daher halten sich solche Schiffe am Besten weit abseits der Frontlinien auf. Trotz dieser Schwächen spielt der Zephyrus eine entscheidende Rolle für den Einsatz der gesamten GTVA-Flotte. Das von Zephyrusschiffen geförderte Deuterium versorgt die Fusionsantriebe der Flotte mit Energie."

Jeder Kampfeinheit der GTVA wurde ein Geschwader Charybdis-Schiffe zugewiesen. Durch diese Schiffe wird die Reichweite der Überwachungssensoren der ganzen Einheit verdoppelt. Charybdis-Schiffe werden wegen der dünnen Schilde und geringen Verteidigungsmöglichkeit leicht zu Opfern der feindlichen Bomber. Sie haben sich jedoch als unentbehrlich erwiesen für Abstecher in die Nebel jenseits des Knossosportals. Schiffe der Charybdis-Klasse werden in dieser Umgebung sehr leicht in Mitleidenschaft gezogen, wie der kürzliche Verlust der GTA Panopticon der 3. Kampfeinheit beweist."

3051, "Mehr als 30 Jahre war die GTD Orion das grösste Schiff der terranisch-vasudanischen Armada. Mit einer Länge von über zwei Kilometern und mit Dutzenden von todbringenden Geschütztürmen übersät ist die Orion gleichsam respekteinflössend - ob friedlich im Dock oder feuerspuckend in einer Schlacht. Alle Orions der GVTA wurden nachträglich mit den neuesten Strahlgeschützen sowie Flak und AAA-Geschützen gegen Jäger und Bomber ausgerüstet. Die tiefliegenden Hangare der Orion beherbergen problemlos mehr als zwei Dutzend Jäger- oder Bomberstaffeln."

3052, "Die neue Klasse der GTD Hecate-Zerstörer ersetzt die Orion als Flaggschiff der terranischen Kampfverbände. Die Hecate ist noch schwerer bewaffnet als die Orion und transportiert über 150 Kampfraumschiffe und eine 10.000köpfige Mannschaft. Die GTD Aquitaine ist ein hervorragendes Beispiel dieser neuen Schiffsklasse; sie dient als Flaggschiff der in Capella stationierten 3. Flotte."

3053, "Die GTD Hades ist sowohl mit Hilfe terranischer als auch shivanischer Militärtechnologien entstanden. Das Schiff wurde vom Galaktisch-Terranischen Geheimdienst (GaTeG) erbaut, dem Nachrichtendienst der alten GTA. Im Jahre 2335 versuchten Drahtzieher des GaTeG die provisorische GTA-Regierung zu stürzen, die in Delta Serpentis errichtet worden war. Nachdem der GaTeG zerschlagen und die Hades vernichtet worden war, wurden alle Forschungsdaten durch die GTA der Geheimhaltungsstufe Omega unterstellt. Es gibt Gerüchte, dass die Allianz versucht hat, den Zerstörer Hades wieder aufzubauen, um daraus mehr über die Aktivitäten des GaTeG zu erfahren. Solche Berichte wurden aus Regierungskreisen jedoch noch nicht bestätigt."

3054, "Die GTI Arcadia ist eine Vielzweckeinrichtung, die seit dem Grossen Krieg im Dienst der terranischen Flotte steht. Fast jedes wichtige Sternensystem beherbergt mindestens eine Arcadia, die oftmals gleichzeitig Handels- und Kommunikationszentrum ist. Zahllose kleinere Schiffe - auch Reparaturschiffe, Jäger und Transporter - finden in einer Arcadia Platz, die stets Zentrum des systemeigenen und interstellaren Verkehrs ist. Wegen ihrer Feuerkraft mit mehr als 20 Geschützen und der Fähigkeit, bis zu zehn Fliegerstaffeln ausschwärmen zu lassen, ist eine Arcadia für feindliche Kräfte kein leichtes Ziel."

3055, "Der Bau der GTVA Colossus war nur durch einen immensen Kraftaufwand möglich, wie es ihn bislang weder in der terranischen noch in der vasudanischen Geschichte gegeben hat. Dieses 6 Kilometer lange Monstrum ist das Ergebnis einer 20-jährigen gemeinschaftlichen Leistung, an der Dutzende von Unternehmen beider Rassen beteiligt waren. Die Colossus ist mit ihren über 80 Geschütztürmen das mächtigste aller Grosskampfschiffe überhaupt. Es bietet Raum für 60 Jäger- und Bomberstaffeln und benötigt eine Crew von mehr als 30.000 Personen. Die Feuerkraft der Colossus ist höher als die der meisten kompletten Kampfverbände der GTVA."

3056, "Korvetten der Deimos-Klasse, wie etwa die GTCv Actium und die GTCv Lysander, sind die allerneueste Ergänzung der terranischen Flotte. Diese schnittigen, ultramodernen Kriegsschiffe sind das Ergebnis einer neuen Entwicklungsstufe des Schiffbaus, die höchste Manövrierfähigkeit und Feuerkraft bieten. Ihr Rumpf ist zum besseren Schutz gegen Strahlen mit einer Molybdänummantelung verstärkt worden, und ihr von den Vasudanern entwickelter Reaktorkern versorgt sie mit mehr Energie pro Tonne als jeder andere Schiffsantrieb der Alliierten. Sowie die Herstellung der Kreuzerklassen Leviathan und Fenris ausläuft, werden diese Korvetten die Grundlage für die Flotte von morgen bilden."

3057, "Die GTC Aeolus ist die erste Kreuzerklasse, die jemals in den RNI-Schiffswerften im Orbit von Laramis II gebaut wurde. Es wurden nur zwei Dutzend dieser Kreuzer in den Dienst der GTVA-Flotte übernommen, und die Produktion wurde 2365 eingestellt. Unter dem Befehl der Alliierten werden Schiffe der Aeolus-Klasse überwiegend zum Schutz langsamer Konvois gegen Jäger- und Bomberstaffeln eingesetzt. Diese Kreuzer werden heutzutage von den meisten Grosskampfschiffen im Einsatz bei weitem übertroffen. Mit ihrer Flak und den AAA-Geschützen sind sie jedoch hervorragend geeignet, um kleinere Maschinen fernzuhalten."

3058, "Die Iceni ist die Kommandofregatte der NTF. Sie wurde unter der persönlichen Leitung von Admiral Bosch in den Freedom-Werften von Polaris gebaut und von der Neoterranischen Front zu Beginn ihres Aufstands gekapert. Mit mehr als zwei Dutzend Geschütztürmen und einem Schutzmantel aus ultradichtem Uran um die Subsysteme handelt es sich bei der Iceni um eine extrem harte Nuss. Wenn Bosch die taktische Führung an Bord übernimmt, kann sich die Iceni mit jedem beliebigen Kampfverband der GTVA messen. In bestimmten Kreisen ist man der Auffassung, dass das Schiff ursprünglich speziell für ein Geheimprojekt der NTF gebaut wurde."

3060, "Die GTT Elysium-Transporter sind schon seit mehr als 40 Jahren im Einsatz. Ihre Bestimmung hat sich seit den Zeiten des Grossen Krieges nicht verändert: Zivilisten und Militärs von einem Sternensystem in ein anderes zu bringen. Die Elysium ist äusserst gering geschützt, hat nur eine einzige Subach HL-7 Kanone und zudem nur eine dünne Panzerung. Nur in Situationen äusserster Bedrängnis wird man sie irgendwo in der Nähe der Front antreffen. Vorstösse und gefährliche Transportaufträge werden fast ausschliesslich von der wesentlich robusteren GTT Argo-Klasse durchgeführt."

3061, "Die GTT Argo ist zum Standardmilitärtransporter der terranischen Flotte geworden. Die Argos befördern manchmal neue Waffen und Prototypen von Kampfgeräten in Testgebiete oder zu Gefechtsstationen an der Front und wieder zurück. Hochrangige Militärs befehligen gelegentlich gerne mal einen Argo, um mit einem gewissen Hauch von Bequemlichkeit von Sternensystem zu Sternensystem zu reisen. Argos werden oft als Transporter für die Sturmtruppen verwendet und befördern Truppen durch schweren Flakbeschuss, um die feindlichen Schiffe zu entern, die das Oberkommando nicht vernichten, sondern erobern will."

3062, "Die GTI Ganymede ist die neueste Reparatur- und Versorgungseinrichtung der Allianz. Ganymedes befinden sich gegenwärtig hinter den Frontlinien der Systeme Vega, Vasuda und Capella. Jede Ganymede kann bis zu fünf Kriegsschiffe gleichzeitig bedienen. Reparaturen aller Art und beliebigen Niveaus können hier an jedem Schiff der GTVA-Flotte durchgeführt werden. Die Ganymedes bietet darüber hinaus auch Modernisierungsdienste an. So ist es dem Alliierten Oberkommando möglich, die Lebensdauer älterer Schiffe zu verlängern, indem die Waffen, Systeme und Maschinen erneuert werden."

3063, "Das Subraumportal im System Gamma Draconis wurde 2367 entdeckt. Die miteinander verflochtenen kreisförmigen Bewegungen seiner Komponenten verursachen anscheinend einen Wirbel im Subraum, der das System Gamma Draconis mit einem anderen Teil des Universums verbindet. Das Team um Dr. Hargrove wird die Anlage weiterhin untersuchen, doch die Ermittlungen sind streng geheim."

3064, "Die GTSG Watchdog gehört zur ersten Generation der terranischen Wachplattformen und ist ein entfernter Vorläufer der Plattformen Cerberus und Alastor. Die Watchdog ist nach heutigem Energiestandard extrem unterversorgt und mit ihrer hauchdünnen Panzerung praktisch wehrlos. Viele Watchdogs sind Überbleibsel aus dem Grossen Krieg, die man an Ort und Stelle im Einsatz gelassen hat, weil es nicht der Mühe wert war, sie zu entfernen oder abzuschalten. Die NTF benutzt gestohlene Watchdogs ab und zu, um Versorgungsdepots oder geringwertige Einrichtungen zu beschützen."

3065, "Bis zum Erscheinen der GTSG Alastor war die GTSG Cerberus die fortschrittlichste Geschützstellung der terranischen Streitkräfte. Während des Grossen Krieges war sie für die terranische Verteidigung lebenswichtig und konnte mehr als 100 vasudanische und shivanische Angreifer verkraften. Doch im gegenwärtigen Konflikt spielt sie nur noch eine nebensächliche Rolle und beschützt Einrichtungen, auf die ein Angriff unwahrscheinlich ist. Bewegungslos und mit nur zwei Subach HL-7 Geschütztürmen ist sie eher eine Ablenkung als eine echte Bedrohung für moderene Kampfgeräte."

3066, "Die Geschützplattform GTSG Alastor kann von Kriegsschiffen ausgesetzt werden, um einen Rückzug abzuschirmen. Man kann mit ihnen auch die Feuerkraft rings um strategisch wichtige Orte verstärken. Obwohl die Alastors allein nur gegen einige wenige Jäger die Stellung halten können, stellen sie als Ergänzung zu einem Kriegsschiff und mehreren Fliegerstaffeln eine vorbildliche Verteidigung gegen so gut wie alle Gegner dar - ausser vielleicht die ganz Verwegenen. Mit den zwei Bessmer-Kohn-Glattrohrgeschützen auf beiden Seiten der Plattform deckt der Alastor den vollen Feuerbereich ab. Die Aufbauten werden mit neuester Cyber-KI im neuralen Netzwerk kontrolliert, um gleichzeitig mehrere Ziele verfolgen zu können."

3067, "Die Fluchtkapsel GTEP Hermes gehört jetzt zur Standardausrüstung eines jeden GTVA-Kriegsschiffes ab Kreuzergrösse. Jedes Schiff besitzt an verschiedenen Stellen der äusseren Hülle mehrere Fluchtkapseln, die magnetisch an Luftschleusen angekoppelt sind. Die Hermes ist nicht zur Evakuierung der gesamten Mannschaft gedacht und bietet nur Raum für bis zu 20 Personen. Jede Kapsel wird von einem kleinen Fusionsmotor angetrieben, der ausreicht, um sie aus der unmittelbaren Umgebung eines explodierenden Schiffes wegzubringen. Sie ist ausserdem in der Lage, Subraumsprünge durchzuführen."

3122, "Der Prototyp des Stealths GVF Ptah war ein supergeheimes Entwicklungsprojekt, das der vasudanischen Firmengruppe Akheton Corp. übertragen wurde, mit dem Ziel, Kampfschiffe für normale Überwachungsstrahlen unsichtbar zu machen- Die Ptahs zeigten schon während ihrer Erprobungsphase erstaunliche Leistungen. Das Tarnmaterial und die Ablenktechnologien, die an den Aussenflächen benutzt wurden, bringen anscheinend auch shivanische Aufklärungssysteme durcheinander. Den Ptah gibt es gegenwärtig nur für ausgewählte Jägerstaffeln der vasudanischen Flotte, und es ist nichts bekannt darüber, wann sie anderweitig erhältlich sind."

3123, "Die GVS Nephtys ist das neueste Versorgungsschiff der vasudanischen Flotte. Sie ist schnell und wendig - unerlässlich, wenn sie in der Hitze des Gefechts an Jäger andocken muss. Mekhu Enterprises hat im hinteren Bereich des Schiffes einen Frachtraum angelegt, in dem zusätzliche Vorräte und Munition für Notfälle gelagert werden können. Mekhu Enterprises hat von Triton Dynamics die Lizenz erhalten, das Magnetstau-Verteilersystem der GTS Hygeia einzusetzen, so dass beide Schiffe gleich problemlos die Kampfflieger mit Raketen und Bomben nachrüsten können. Da die Nephtys eine grosse Anzahl Gefechtsköpfe mit sich führt, sollte man besser weit weg von diesem gefährlichen Schiff sein, falls es einmal hochgeht."

3124, "Die GVT Isis wird meistens als Transporter für militärisches Personal verwendet. Sie dient jedoch auch gelegentlich als Reparaturschiff oder sogar als Schlepper, um grosse Schiffe ins Dock zu manövrieren. Zwei Geschütztürme mit Kanonen und eine dicke Molybdänpanzerung helfen, ihre Fracht zu schützen. Magnetische Frachtschleusen am Unterbau der Isis können in Notfällen kleine Frachtcontainer mit Vorräten und Munition transportieren."

3125, "Die Klasse der Ma'at-Frachter diente dem vasudanischen Militär mehr als 50 Jahre lang. Über 200 dieser Schiffe stehen noch im Dienste der GTVA und befördern die dringend notwendigen Vorräte, Nahrung und Munition an alle Kriegsschauplätze. Ein einzelner Ma'at ist mit seinen drei Geschützen leichte Beute für eine Staffel feindlicher Bomber. Daher fahren Ma'ats gewöhnlich in Konvois mit anderen Frachtern, wo sie durch Kreuzer und Jägerstaffeln abgesichert werden."

3126, "Im Verlauf der letzten 20 Jahre war der GVFr Bes die Stütze der vasudanischen Transportflotte. Während einige der terranischen Systeme in Nachkriegszeiten darniederlagen, erlebten die Vasudaner einen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung, der schon an ein Wunder grenzte, wenn man bedenkt, dass ihr Heimatplanet ausgelöscht worden war. Experten schreiben das der Politik der wieder eingesetzten Imperialen Regierung zu, die in Erscheinung trat, nachdem Khonsu II. das vasudanische Parlament aufgelöst hatte. Als der innervasudanische Handel zwischen den Systemen wieder aufgenommen wurde und sich bis in terranische Welten ausweitete, benötigte man eine neue Generation von Raumfrachtern, um den Ansprüchen dieser aufblühenden Wirtschaft gerecht zu werden."

3127, "Der vasudanische VAC 5 ist ein gepanzerter Frachtcontainer, mit dem zerbrechliche oder wertvolle Ausrüstungsgegenstände an die Front transportiert werden können. Diese Container sind besser geschützt als die meisten Kampfraumschiffe, so dass ihre Ladung wahrscheinlich Aufschläge und vereinzelte Energiestösse gut überstehen wird."

3128, "Der vasudanische VAC 4 ist ein gepanzerter Frachtcontainer, mit dem empfindliche und wertvolle Ausrüstungsgegenstände an die Front transportiert werden können. Diese Container sind besser geschützt als die meisten Kampfraumschiffe, so dass ihre Ladung wahrscheinlich Aufschläge und einzelne Energiestösse gut überstehen wird."

3129, "Als die terranischen Streitkräfte im Verlauf des terranisch-vasudanischen Krieges das erste Mal einem Satis-Frachter begegneten, verleitete dessen Feuerkraft das Terranische Oberkommando dazu, ihn als leichten Kreuzer einzustufen. Erst als man einen manövrierunfähigen Satis erobert hatte, kam sein eigentlicher Zweck zum Vorschein. Frachter, die jetzt der Klasse GVFr Satis zugeordnet sind, haben in einem Frachterkonvoi oft die Rolle eines Wolfs im Schafspelz. Ein paar feindliche Jäger, die einen Satis irrtümlich für einen Ma'at oder Bes hielten, mussten ihren Fehler sehr bedauern."

3130, "Der GVG Anuket war ursprünglich für die Rohstoffgewinnung in der flüchtigen Umgebung von Gasriesen entwickelt worden. In letzter Zeit wurde der Anuket jedoch für den Einsatz in Nebeln umgebaut. Der Anuket ist ausgestattet mit dem derzeit ausgereiftesten Sensorfeld, wodurch es ihm möglich ist, durch die starken EM-Mahlströme aus Supernova-Rückständen zu navigieren. In einem Nebel erfüllt der Anuket zwei wichtige Aufgaben. Erstens sammelt er Proben für wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen und dient als Labor für Feldexperimente. Zweitens sammelt der Anuket Deuterium-reiches Gas, das in den Fusionsantrieben der alliierten Flotte verwendet werden kann."

3131, "Die GVC Aten gehört zu den kleinsten Kreuzern der GTVA. Sie hat nur eine dünne Panzerung und wenige, ziemlich schwache Gefechtstürme. Terranische Jäger und Bomber nutzten diese Schwäche in den Anfängen des Grossen Krieges weidlich aus, als Terraner und Vasudaner noch Gegner waren. Die Aten sieht man im gegenwärtigen Konflikt oft als rückwärtige Absicherung für Konvois oder Einrichtungen, wo sie Jäger- und Bomberstaffeln Deckung geben kann."

3132, "Der Kreuzer GVC Mentu ist das leichteste der neuen vasudanischen Kriegsschiffe. Im Anschluss an den Grossen Krieg entwickelten die Wissenschaftler der Alliierten die Strahlgeschütze, die jetzt die Hauptausrüstung der heutigen Kriegsschiffe der GTVA darstellen. Anstatt die vorhandenen Schiffe umzubauen, entwickelten die Vasudaner neue, um diese Waffen darauf aufzubauen. Die 16 Geschütztürme des Mentu bieten sowohl schwere Strahlgeschütze, um andere Kriegsschiffe anzugreifen, als auch AAA und Flakgeschütze, um kleinere Schiffe abzuwehren. Die Stärke der Mentu-Klasse wurde kürzlich an der GVC Somtus und GVC Mycerinus der NFT-Streitkräfte in Epsilon Pegasi demonstriert."

3133, "Die Entwicklung der Korvette GVCv Sobek begann bereits in den schlechten Zeiten nach der Vernichtung von Vasuda Prime durch die Shivaner im Grossen Krieg. Die vasudanische Streitmacht wollte ein Schiff, das einem shivanischen Kreuzer ohne weitere Hilfe entgegentreten und das die vasudanischen Zerstörer im Kampf gegen shivanische Hauptschiffe entscheidend unterstützen konnte. Die Sobek-Klasse erfüllt diese Anforderungen auf bewundernswerte Weise. Übersät mit fast zwei Dutzend Geschütztürmen sind diese Korvetten für alle Schiffe bis zur Grösse eines Kreuzers ein Horror, und sie bringen sogar Schiffe in Not, die grösser als sie selbst sind."

3134, "Mit dem Einsatz der GVD Typhon gegen die terranischen Streitkräfte zu Anfang des terranisch-vasudanischen Krieges erreichte die vasudanische Militärtechnologie ihren Höhepunkt. Die erste Typhon wurde im Vega-Gefecht gesichtet, wo sie schnell die GTD Eisenhower und einen Grossteil der 4. Flotte vernichtete. Die neuere Zerstörer-Klasse Hatshepsut ist grösser und führt ein bedrohlicheres Waffenaufgebot mit sich, doch die Typhon kann es mit den meisten Gegnern immer noch aufnehmen. Bis zu 30 Jäger- bzw. Bomberstaffeln können in den Hangars untergebracht werden - bereit, jeden Moment loszuschlagen."

3135, "Die Geschützplattform GVSG Ankh ist das vasudanische Gegenstück zur GTSG Watchdog. Bei beiden handelt es sich um Relikte aus dem Grossen Krieg, die nach modernem Massstab nur mangelhafte Dienste leisten. Mit der Ankh werden die Vorratslager und Einrichtungen an den hinteren Linien bewacht und geschützt. Da es weder Panzerung noch Schilde gibt, ist die Ankh schnell zerstört. Mit ihren zwei kleinen Gefechtstürmen können unbewaffnete Angreifer oder schwer beschädigte Jäger aufgehalten werden, doch für die meisten Raumschiffe ist sie nur eine schwache Bedrohung."

3136, "Als die GTVA die vasudanische Streitmacht bat, die Gefechtsplattform Ankh aus Kriegszeiten zu überarbeiten, lieferten die Vasudaner die GVSG Edjo als Antwort. Die Edjo ist bedeutend besser gepanzert als die Ankh, wodurch eine höhere Widerstandsfähigkeit erreicht wurde, doch die Vasudaner setzten nur eine kleine Gefechtskanone auf die neue Plattform, so dass sie nur halb soviel Schlagkraft wie die Ankh hatte. Als die Terraner die Edjo gesehen hatten, begannen sie stillschweigend, ihre eigenen fortschrittlicheren Geschützplattformen zu entwickeln. Die vasudanische Streitmacht scheint damit zufrieden zu sein, dass die Terraner diesen Bereich der Militärtechnologie übernommen haben."

3137, "Die Fluchtkapsel GVEP Ra ist das gängige Notfallfahrzeug auf vasudanischen Hauptschiffen seit dem terranisch-vasudanischen Krieg. Im Einklang mit der vasudanischen Philosophie wird Ra fast nie dazu benutzt, Personen zu evakuieren, sondern stattdessen nur, um Aufzeichnungen und andere Daten zu bewahren, die den Alliierten von Nutzen sein könnten. Daher verfügt Ra nur über wenig lebenserhaltende Systeme und einen kleinen Fusionsmotor. Die Kraft, die die Energieanlage der Fluchtkapsel liefert, wird fast vollständig dazu verwendet, den Leitstrahlsender zu versorgen."

3138, "Die GVA Setekh gehört zur den vasudanischen AWACS-Schiffen und ist vergleichbar mit der terranischen GTA Charybdis. Setekhs sind kleiner, weniger gepanzert und besitzen nur halb soviele Geschütztürme wie die Charybdis-Schiffe. Trotz dieser Unzulänglichkeiten besteht die vasudanische Streitmacht darauf, Setekhs in vasudanischen Kampfverbänden einzusetzen und behauptet, die vasudanischen Modelle wären für ihre Flotte besser geeignet. Die kristalline Sensorüberwachung der Setekhs bieten der Flotte in den Nebeln einen doppelt so grossen Radarbereich. Jedem vasudanischen Kampfverband, der dort operiert, ist eine Staffel Setekhs zugeordnet."

3139, "Im Jahre 2360 gab das Alliierte Oberkommando den ersten Zerstörer der GVD Hatshepsut-Klasse in Auftrag. Das vasudanische Unternehmen Akheton entwarf die Hatshepsut so, dass die neuen Strahlenkanonen zweckmässig und effizient integriert werden konnten. Der Versuch, die älteren Kriegsschiffe der Typhon-Klasse umzurüsten, führte dazu, dass die Schiffe jetzt verstärkt von Systemausfällen und Reaktorüberlastung betroffen sind. Auch wenn immer noch eine Handvoll Typhons im Dienst steht, ist die Hatshepsut inzwischen ganz klar der bevorzugte vasudanische Zerstörer. Mit ihren 24 Gefechtstürmen, 5 Strahlegeschützen und 2 Jägerhangaren dienen Zerstörer wie die GVD Psamtik vom 13. Kampfverband Deneb als Rückgrat der modernen vasudanischen Flotte."

3140, "Der shivanische Jäger SF Dragon ist eine schnelle und ausgesprochen wendige Maschine. Seine Doppellaser geben ihm todbringende Schlagkraft. Die Schwäche des Dragons scheint in seiner dünnen Panzerung zu liegen. Es ist besonders ärgerlich, dass er auf Grund seiner Geschwindigkeit und Manövrierfähigkeit äusserst schwer zu treffen ist."

3141, "Der SF Basilisk ist eine schwerer shivanischer Angriffsjäger. Da er selbst langsam, aber schwer gepanzert und gut geschützt ist, nimmt ein Basilisk langsame Schiffe ins Visier, wie etwa Bomber, Frachter und Gasgewinnungsschiffe. Die mächtigen Laser machen Basilisken zur Gefahr für all diese Schiffe; daher müssen sie so schnell wie möglich unter Beschuss genommen und vernichtet werden."

3142, "Der Jäger Manticore ist bekannt als das schnellste Raumschiff der shivanischen Armada. Mit nur einem einzigen, kraftvollen Laser und zwei Raketenlafetten ist er eine gefährliche Offensivwaffe. Angreifbar ist er nur wegen seiner dünnen Panzerung und den schwachen Schilden. Manticores halten im Nahkampf gegen andere Jäger nicht lange durch. Sie ziehen es vor, Bomber aufs Korn zu nehmen, die gegen die Geschwindigkeit und Bewaffnung eines Manticores praktisch hilflos sind."

3143, "Dem shivanischen Jäger SF Aeshma, der erst kürzlich das erste Mal in Erscheinung trat, begegnet man relativ selten. Es scheint sich dabei um einen ähnlich schweren Angriffsjäger zu handeln wie den Basilisk. Bekannt ist, dass die Spitzengeschwindigkeit recht niedrig ist, so dass Aeshmas offenbar eher langsame Schiffe ansteuern werden, wie Bomber, Frachter und Gasgewinnungsschiffe. Ihre kraftvollen Laser machen sie zu einer Gefahr für all diese Schiffe; daher müssen sie so schnell wie möglich unter Beschuss genommen und zerstört werden."

3144, "Die SF Mara ist ein shivanischer Jäger, dem erstmals die GTC Vigilant während einer Patrouille am Sprungknoten Gamma Draconis im Capella-System begegnete. Alle weiteren Informationen betreffend Mara unterliegen der Geheimhaltungsstufe Psi."

3145, "Nach der ersten Begegnung in Gamma Draconis scheint es, dass der SF Astaroth ein schneller, beweglicher Jäger ist, dessen Wendigkeit offenbar Nachteile bei Panzerung und Bewaffnung mit sich bringt. Wenn die Schilde eines Astaroth keinen Widerstand mehr leisten, kann der Jäger schnell erledigt werden."

3146, "Der SB Nephilim ist der langsamste der shivanischen Bomber. Diese Raumschiffe wurden erstmals während des Grossen Krieges gesichtet und sind in manchen shivanischen Angriffsformationen immer noch zu finden. Nephilims sind schwer gepanzert und mit Schilden abgeschirmt, so dass sie ihre verheerenden Sprengladungen trotz der eingeschränkten Geschwindigkeit absetzen können."

3147, "Der SB Taurvi ist ein shivanisches Schiff, das erst kürzlich das erste Mal auftauchte. Der Taurvi gehört zu den etwas schwächeren shivanischen Bombern, kann es aber trotzdem mit jedem Bomber der GTVA aufnehmen. Da er nicht so wendig ist wie eine Nahema und nicht so robust wie ein Seraphim oder Nephilim, hat es den Anschein, als hätten die Shivaner mit dem Taurvi einen Kompromiss zwischen Tempo und Kraft geschlossen."

3148, "Entweder handelt es sich bei der SB Nahema um eine shivanische Neuentwicklung eines Bombers, oder die Shivaner nehmen die GTVA endlich ernst und bringen ihre besten Schiffe ins Spiel. Die Nahema gilt als der gefährlichste Bomber der Shivaner. Sie hat ihre Fähigkeit demonstriert, so gut wie jeden Jäger der GTVA-Flotte zu übertreffen. Ihre mächtigen Laserlafetten und Hochleistungs-Raketenwerfer machen sie zu einer Bedrohung für sämtliche Raumschiffe, Grosskampfschiffe nicht ausgenommen."

3149, "Der SB Seraphim ist ein alter Bekannter der GTVA-Streitkräfte. Was Geschwindigkeit, Panzerung und Schildstärke betrifft, scheint er dem Nephilim ähnlich zu sein, doch erwiesenermassen kann er mehr Bomben mit sich führen."

3150, "Seit die Shivaner am Grossen Krieg beteiligt waren, gab es selten die Gelegenheit, dem ST Azrael zu begegnen, dem einzigen bekannten shivanischen Transporter. Man weiss bis heute wenig darüber, aber man glaubt, dass er viele Shivaner in seinem Rumpf aufnehmen kann. Da Azraels auch shivanische Piloten oder andere wichtige Truppen an Bord haben könnten, ist es immer ratsam, diese nur leicht gepanzerten Schiffe zu liquidieren."

3151, "Der Frachter SFr Dis ist kleiner als der Asmodeus und lange nicht so gut bewaffnet. Trotzdem ist es immer noch gefährlicher, einen solchen Frachter anzugreifen als einen Triton oder Poseidon der GTVA."

3152, "Die SAC 3 sind die bisher gebräuchlichsten shivanischen Frachtcontainer. Sie sind so dünn gepanzert, dass es kaum reicht, dem Druck der inneren Atmosphäre gegen die Leere des Raums standzuhalten. Da man sich ausserdem nicht bemüht hat, die Container gegen Angriffe zu schützen, wird angenommen, dass darin nur unwichtige Gegenstände von geringem Wert befördert werden. Trotzdem gilt der Befehl, solche Container bei sich bietender Gelegenheit aufzugreifen, wenn nicht ausdrücklich eine anderslautende Anweisung gegeben wurde."

3153, "Der Frachter SFr Mephisto ist betreffend Grösse und Leistung vergleichbar mit der Dis-Klasse. In Anbetracht der extrem unterschiedlichen Konfiguration müssen sie den Shivanern für verschiedene Zwecke dienen, doch das Alliierte Oberkommando gibt hierzu gegenwärtig keine weiteren Informationen."

3154, "Soweit die Ingenieure der GTVA es feststellen konnten, ist der Frachtcontainer SC 5 der Shivaner von der Funktion her mit dem SAC 3 identisch. Wie für alle shivanischen Frachtcontainer gilt auch hier der Befehl, sie bei Gelegenheit aufzunehmen, ausser wenn ausdrücklich ein anderer Auftrag gegeben wurde."

3155, "Man weiss über die Frachterserie SFr Asmodeus nur sehr wenig. Ein Angriff auf diese shivanischen Frachter ist wegen der starken Hülle und der vier Geschütztürme recht gefährlich. Über die Fracht, die Asmodeus-Frachter gewöhnlich transportieren, ist nichts bekannt."

3156, "Bei dem SAC 2 handelt es sich um eine schwer gepanzerte Variante des üblichen shivanischen Frachtcontainers. Ausrüstungen, die man in eroberten SAC 2 fand, schienen empfindlicher zu sein als solche, die in den gängigen SAC 3 enthalten waren. SAC 2 Frachtcontainer sollen auf jeden Fall aufgenommen anstatt zerstört werden. Falls sie vor der Entscheidung stehen, einen Container zu vernichten oder ihn shivanischen Streitkräften zu überlassen, haben die Piloten die ausdrückliche Erlaubnis, den Container zu zerstören."

3157, "Die shivanischen Lilith-Kreuzer sind viel bedrohlichere Gegner als die Cain-Klasse. Mit ihrer fast undurchdringlichen Panzerung können sie gewaltigem Beschuss widerstehen. Ihre neun Geschütztürme können Kriegsschiffe und Jäger erbarmungslos befeuern."

3158, "Auch wenn der shivanische Kreuzer Rakshasa nicht so dick gepanzert ist wie die Lilith, so ist er doch weit gefährlicher. Mit mehr als einem Dutzend Geschütztürmen ist die Rakshasa-Klasse der am besten bewaffnete shivanische Kreuzer. Es war ein Rakshasa-Kreuzer, der die GTC Vigilant am Gamma-Draconis-Knoten im Capella-System zerstörte."

3159, "Die schwächsten shivanischen Kreuzer gehören zur Cain-Klasse. Auf diese Schiffe traf man gewöhnlich in den Schlachten des Grossen Krieges. Cains sollen den Kreuzern der Fenris-Klasse angeblich leicht überlegen sein."

3160, "Die SD Demon, ein shivanischer Zerstörer, ist wesentlich kleiner als die Lucifer, aber viel schwerer bewaffnet und extrem gefährlich. Man weiss, dass die Demons zahllose Jäger- und Bomberstaffeln mit sich führen."

3161, "Der Zerstörer SD Ravana wurde von GTVA-Streitkräften erst kürzlich entdeckt. Anscheinend dient er dazu, kleinere Gegner ausfindig zu machen - eine Aufgabe, für die er sehr gut geeignet ist. Er radiert mühelos ganze Jäger- oder Bomberstaffeln aus und bezwingt sogar Kreuzer und Korvetten."

3162, "Die SD Lucifer war ein massiver Superzerstörer, der die shivanische Armada im Grossen Krieg anführte. Keine Waffe aus dem Arsenal der Alliierten konnte Lucifers Schilde durchdringen. Im Altair-System entdeckten vasudanische Wissenschaftler uralte Artefakte, die erklärten, wie man Schiffe in den Subraum verfolgt - dorthin, wo die Schilde der Lucifers nicht mehr funktionierten. Der verzweifelte Versuch, die Lucifer im Subraum anzugreifen, hatte schliesslich Erfolg. Durch die Explosion der Lucifer brach der Sprungknoten nach Sol zusammen, so dass jeder Kontakt mit der Erde abgebrochen war. Mit dem Sieg über die Lucifer war die shivanische Invasion effektiv beendet."

3163, "Die Reihe der SSG Trident-Geschützplattformen kennt man durch die zahlreichen Begegnungen während des Grossen Krieges. Sie werden immer noch dazu benutzt, shivanische Einrichtungen zu schützen, doch für die wichtigen Verteidigungspositionen hat man inzwischen viele der besser ausgerüsteten Belial-Plattformen eingesetzt."

3164, "Die Gefechtsplattform SSG Belial scheint eine radikale Weiterentwicklung der Trident-Plattform zu sein, die es bereits zu Zeiten des Grossen Krieges gab. Piloten, die schon mit beiden zu tun hatten, berichten, dass die Belial viel schwieriger zu zerstören ist. Aus verlässlicher Quelle wurde bekannt, dass die Belial über doppelt so viele Lasergeschütztürme verfügt wie die Trident. Beide werden dazu verwendet, Vorratsdepots, Gasförderschiffe und andere shivanische Einrichtungen zu schützen."

3165, "Man weiss so gut wie gar nichts über die Rahu-Gasförderschiffe. Man nimmt an, dass sie auf die gleiche Weise arbeiten wie unsere Zephyrus-Förderschiffe und das Gas aus den Nebeln einer internen Maschinerie zuleiten, die es in seine Molekularbestandteile zerlegt, damit es weiterverarbeitet werden kann. Die Rahu ist mit schweren Lasergefechtstürmen bewaffnet; bei einem Angriff muss man also sehr vorsichtig sein."

3166, "Ein einziges shivanisches Schiff kann als Korvette bezeichnet werden - die SCv Moloch. Obwohl sie von den Massen her genau so gross sind wie die GTCv Deimos, so scheint die Moloch doch nicht über die gleiche Schlagkraft zu verfügen. Andererseits sind sie wesentlich gefährlicher als die shivanischen Kreuzer."

3167, "Über das shivanische Schlachtschiff der Juggernaut-Klasse, die SJ Sathanas, weiss man recht wenig. Von der Leistungsfähigkeit her scheint sie mit dem GTVA Colossus vergleichbar zu sein. Jegliche Information über die Sathanas wurde der Geheimhaltungstufe Ypsilon unterworfen."

3168, "Ein Sathanas-Schlachtschiff in der Ferne."

Sie ist eine Gefahr für jeden feindlichen Jäger oder Bomber, der in Reichweite kommt. Mit ihren beiden Strahlgeschützen und drei Raketenlafetten kann sie mehrere Gegner gleichzeitig bekämpfen. Diese ferngelenkten Waffenträger schützen zur Zeit nur die wichtigsten Frontstellungen der Allianz."

3184, "Der Grosse Krieg"

3185, "Im Jahre 2335 jährte sich der terranisch-vasudanische Krieg zum 14. Mal. Die Galaktische Terranische Allianz (GTA) und die Parlamentarische Vasudanische Flotte (PVF) waren ausgelaugt und demoralisiert. Sie standen beide kurz vor dem endgültigen Zusammenbruch. 

Doch die Invasion einer geheimnisvollen Spezies, die sich Shivaner nannte, zwang die Führer der Terraner und Vasudaner, einen Waffenstillstand zu unterzeichnen und ein neues Bündnis zu schmieden. Aufgrund ihrer fortgeschrittenen Waffen- und Schutzschildtechnologie waren die Shivaner in der Lage, ohne Provokation und ohne jede Vorwarnung anzugreifen. 

Die neuen Verbündeten erwarben und entwickelten ihrerseits neue Technologien, um der unerwarteten Bedrohung zu begegnen. Die Vorhut der shivanischen Flotte bestand aus der SD Lucifer, einem riesigen Superzerstörer. Auf Vasuda Prime hatte die Lucifer schon alles Leben ausgelöscht und nahm nun Kurs auf die Erde. Die Alliierten besassen kein Waffensystem in ihrem Arsenal, das die Schilde der Lucifer hätte durchdringen können. 

Doch im Altair-System entdeckten vasudanische Wissenschaftler die Ruinen einer ausgestorbenen Zivilisation, die vor 8000 Jahren von den Shivanern zerstört worden war. Die Artefakte gaben Aufschluss darüber, wie man die Lucifer bis in den Subraum verfolgen konnte, wo ihre Schilde nicht funktionierten. Nur dort war die Lucifer verwundbar. 

Im Delta-Serpentis-System startete von der GTD Bastion aus ein Geschwader, das der Lucifer in den Sol-Sprungknoten folgte. Die Jäger und Bomber hatten nur einen Auftrag: die Reaktoren der Lucifer auszuschalten, bevor der Superzerstörer auch das Leben auf der Erde auslöschen konnte. 

Den zur Veröffentlichung freigegebenen Funkprotokollen zufolge muss der Einsatz erfolgreich verlaufen sein. Doch die Explosion der Lucifer verursachte im Subraum einen Kataklysmus, der alle Kontakte zwischen der Erde und den anderen Systemen des terranisch-vasudanischen Raums durchtrennte."

3186, "Der Wiederaufbau"

3187, "Gegen Ende des Jahres 2335 war der Grosse Krieg endgültig vorüber. Der Sieg über die Lucifer war der entscheidende Schlag - von diesem Moment an waren die Shivaner zu koordinierten Angriffen- oder strategischer Planung nicht mehr in der Lage. Ihre Flotte wurde ausmanövriert, isoliert und schrittweise zerstört. Dennoch gelang es beiden Rassen, ihre interstellaren Gesellschaften von Grund auf neu aufzubauen.

Ein unheilvoller Staatsstreich, inszeniert vom aufständischen Geheimdienst der GTA, markierte den Beginn der politischen Teilungen während der Nachkriegszeit. Die Galaktisch-Terranische Allianz, deren Wirtschaft am Boden und deren politische Struktur in Trümmern lag, zerfiel zusehends in halb-autonome, regionale Machtblöcke mit eigenen Interessenschwerpunkten. Zu den grösseren Einheiten gehörten die Adhara-Koalition, die Antares-Föderation, das Regulus-Syndikat und die Neue Luyten-Allianz. Nach und nach gelang es diesen Blöcken, sich zu stabilisieren, der Neuaufbau gewann zunehmend an Schwung und der wiedereinsetzende freie Handel belebte den Gedanken an eine pan-terranische Gemeinschaft neu.

Trotz der völligen Auslöschung allen Lebens in ihrem Heimatsystem übertraf der vasudanische Aufschwung den seiner terranischen Alliierten. Die Vasudanier wurden bis 2339 von einem Parlament regiert, bis der vasudanische Herrscher Khonsu II. die für ihren byzantinischen Verrat, ihre Bestechlichkeit und Arroganz berüchtigte Kammer auflöste und eine neue Regierung ins Leben rief. Khonsu, der Nachkomme einer 10.000 Jahre alten Dynastie, erwies sich als Herrscher von ungewöhnlichem Scharfsinn und grosser Weisheit. Wirtschaftsfachleute machen Khonsus Regentschaft für den erstaunlichen Wiederaufbau der vasudanischen Industrie und Gesellschaft verantwortlich."

3188, "Die GTVA"

3189, "Die Galaktische Terranisch-Vasudanische Allianz (GTVA) wurde im Jahre 2345 gegründet, zehn Jahre nach dem Grossen Krieg. Dieses Vertragsbündnis erkannte die Unabhängigkeit seiner Signatarstaaten an und bildete das Gerüst für den Ausbau des Handels und die gegenseitige Verteidigung. Der Grosse Krieg hatte die Feindschaft zwischen Terranern und Vasudanern in ein stabile und dauerhafte Freundschaft verwandelt.

Nachdem sich Industrie und Wirtschaft des Terranisch-Vasudanischen Systems wieder erholt hatten, gewann auch die Idee einer noch mächtigeren GVTA an Bedeutung. Im Jahr 2358 unterzeichneten Delegierte beider Seiten die Beta-Aquilae-Konvention (BETAK), benannt nach dem System, in dem die Übereinkunft geschlossen und ratifiziert worden war. Die BETAK trat an die Stelle der terranischen Blöcke und erkannte die Generalversammlung, den Sicherheitsrat und das Vasudanische Imperium als höchste Autoritäten im terranisch-vasudanischen Raum an. 

Im Rahmen der BETAK unterhalten Terraner und Vasudaner voneinander getrennte Flotten, die allerdings einer gemeinsamen Befehlsstruktur unterliegen. Die Kriegsschiffe sind entweder mit einem GT oder einem GV gekennzeichnet, je nachdem, ob sie galaktisch-terranischer oder galaktisch-vasudanischer Herkunft sind. Die beiden Spezies tauschen offen Informationen und Technologien aus, und die unlängst entwickelten Jäger und Bomber lassen sich so modifizieren, dass sie von den Piloten beider Rassen gesteuert werden können.

Formal gesehen ist die BETAK nur ein Abkommen unter vielen, das die Abläufe innerhalb der GTVA als politischer, militärischer und wirtschaftlicher Einheit regelt. Dennoch wird die BETAK zu Recht als Meilenstein der terranisch-vasudanischen Allianz angesehen und genau das macht sie zum bevorzugten Angriffsziel der NTF-Propagandisten."

3190, "Die Erde"

3191, "Im Jahre 2335 brachte die Zerstörung der Lucifer auch den Sol-Sprungknoten in Delta Serpentis zum Einsturz und liess den Kontakt zur Erde abbrechen.

Das Schicksal des Heimatplaneten der Terraner bleibt also offen für Spekulationen. Denkbar ist eine ganze Reihe von Szenarien. Als ehemaliges Zentrum der interstellaren Gemeinschaft dürfte eine isolierte Erde ohne radikale Umwälzung aller politischen und wirtschaftlichen Strukturen wohl kaum überlebt haben. Darüber herrscht Einigkeit. Doch die Frage bleibt, ob dieser Übergang friedlich vonstatten gegangen oder ob die terranische Gesellschaft zusammengebrochen ist und sich nun im Zustand offener Anarchie befindet. Für beide Annahmen gibt es gute Gründe.

Über Generationen hinweg war die Erde das politische, ökonomische und kulturelle Zentrum der terranischen Zivilisation. Die Menschen massen die Zeit immer noch in Stunden, Tagen, Monaten und Jahren. Sie benannten ihre Schiffe nach mythischen Figuren alter terranischer Zivilisationen und identifizierten Systeme immer noch anhand der Konstellationen, die sie von der Erde aus beobachten konnten. Der Planet diente der GTA als Hauptquartier, und der grösste Teil der Industrie war innerhalb des Sol-Systems angesiedelt. Aussenweltler bestimmten ihre Nationalität anhand alter Grenzen auf der Erde, obwohl sich die Nationalstaaten nach der Entdeckung des Subraums und der Herausbildung einer interstellaren terranischen Gesellschaft längst aufgelöst hatten.

Obwohl die faktische Bedeutung der Erde in der Nachkriegszeit merklich zurückgegangen ist, geniesst die Entdeckung von Möglichkeiten zur Rückkehr in die alte Heimat nach wie vor hohe Priorität."

3192, "Die NTF"

3193, "Vor achtzehn Monaten startete Admiral Aken Bosch, Kommandant der 6.-GTVA-Flotte, einen militärischen Überraschungsangriff auf das Polaris-System. Daraufhin setzte eine Art regionaler Dominoeffekt ein: Innerhalb weniger Wochen stürzten die Regierungen von Regulus und Sirius, deren Nachfolger kurze Zeit später Bosch und seiner NTF die Treue schworen.

Im Mittelpunkt der Ideologie dieser Bewegung steht Boschs Vision von Neu-Terra. Obwohl die Menschen seit Ende des Grossen Kriegs im Exil lebten, beschwört Bosch ein Utopia, das die gleiche Bedeutung besitzt wie die längst untergegangene Welt. So wie Polaris einst den Menschen der Erde bei der Navigation durch die Meere half, so sollte der Nordstern jetzt zum spirituellen und politischen Kompass einer neuen Zeit werden. Boschs Botschaft fiel besonders bei der sogenannten 'Verlorenen Generation', die im Laufe des Nachkriegsaufbaus geboren worden war, auf fruchtbaren Boden. Die Neue Terranische Front gab der Jugend von Polaris, Regulus und Sirius wieder eine Vision, für die sich zu kämpfen und zu sterben lohnte.

Boschs Erfolg beruhte aber auch darauf, dass seine Ideologie eines Neuen Terra ausdrücklich anti-vasudanistisch war. Die NTF war ein strikter Gegner jeder terranisch-vasudanischer Allianz und rief zur Auflösung der GTVA auf. Die zentralen Systeme der NTF hatten während des Wiederaufbaus in der Nachkriegszeit mit grossen politischen und ökonomischen Problemen zu kämpfen. Der kaum glaubliche Aufschwung der Vasudaner unter Khonsu II. verbitterte jene Terraner, die beim Aufbau ihrer eigenen Systeme kaum weitergekommen waren. Bosch nutzte dieses anti-vasudanische Ressentiment geschickt für seine politischen Zwecke aus."

3194, "Die Vasudaner"

3195, "Die Vasudaner sind eine Zivilisation von Philosophen, Künstlern und Gelehrten. Sie vertiefen sich in die Lehren ihrer Vorfahren und verstehen die Geschichte nicht als lineare Abfolge von Ereignissen, sondern als Raum, der von den Lebenden ebenso bevölkert wird wie von den Toten. 

Auf den terranischen Aussenstehenden wirkt die vasudanische Gesellschaft verwickelt und ritualistisch. Die Vasudaner selbst erscheinen den Menschen als arrogant, hinterhältig und abergläubisch. Auf der anderen Seite empfinden Vasudaner Terraner als aggressiv, paranoid und dumm. Dreissig Jahre des friedlichen Zusammenlebens haben dazu geführt, dass solche Vorurteile langsam aber sicher abgebaut werden konnten.

Die grösste Leistung der vasudanischen Zivilisation aber ist ihre Sprache. Für einen Durchschnittsterraner sind die Formalitäten ihres Gebrauchs schlichtweg unverständlich. Satzbau und Wortschatz sind abhängig von Faktoren wie dem Alter des Sprechers, seinem Rang und seiner Kaste, aber auch von der Tageszeit, der Jahreszeit des vasudanischen Kalenders und dem räumlichen Verhältnis des Sprechers zum Herrscher. Zu diesen Faktoren gesellen sich noch verschiedene Alphabete, Dutzende unterschiedlicher Zeitformen und tausende Dialekte hinzu. Ein Übersetzungsgerät gehört zur Standardausrüstung aller Kommunikationssysteme innerhalb der GVTA, das eine Verständigung zwischen Terranern und Vasudanern erst möglich macht.

Weil die vasudanische Heimatwelt im wesentlichen aus Wüste bestand, gaben die Terraner während der beiden Kriege den Schiffen der Vasudaner ägyptische Namen. Nach der Niederlage der Shivaner bestanden die Vasudaner darauf, diese Konvention beizubehalten. Der Herrscher identifizierte sich stark mit der Geschichte des alten Ägypten, insbesondere mit der Langlebigkeit ihrer Zivilisation. Dem Beispiel ihres Herrschers folgend übernehmen die Vasudaner die Namen aus den Mythen und der Geschichte des alten Ägypten."

3196, "Der Lichthammer"

3197, "Es gibt eine dunkle Seite der vasudanischen Besessenheit von der Geschichte - sichtbar wurde sie während des Krieges in Gestalt des 'Lichthammers', einer Sekte, die innerhalb der PVF wegen des Abfalls von den Lichthammer-Grundsätzen viele Anhänger fand. Der Lichthammer hielt die Shivaner für die kosmischen Erlöser und Zerstörer, deren Ankunft in jahrtausendealten Schriften prophezeit worden war. Nach der Zerstörung der Lucifer begann sich die Ideologie des Hammers zu wandeln. 

Während einige Anhänger rituellen Selbstmord verübten, setzte der militärische Arm der Bewegung den bewaffneten Kampf gegen die vasudanische Regierung und deren Allianz mit den Terranern fort. Auch wenn diese Leute der religiösen Dogmatik des Lichthammers weiter folgten, verwandelten sich ihre Aktivitäten doch zunehmend in reine Terrorakte und Guerilla-Kriegsführung. Dieser Zweig des Lichthammers wurde später im Zuge der Operation Templar, als man die gesamte vasudanische Admiralität entführte, vollständig ausgelöscht. Andere Lichthammer-Anführer verschwanden in der Dunkelheit und kehrten zum Studium der alter mystischen Schriften zurück. Eine Reihe dieser religiösen Führer wurde später festgenommen und für ihre Rolle beim Aufstand zu Haftstrafen verurteilt. Einige wenige aber verstecken sich noch immer."

3198, "Die Shivaner"

3199, "32 Jahre nach dem Grossen Krieg wissen wir nach wie vor kaum etwas über die Shivaner. 

Physisch besitzen die Shivaner mehrere miteinander verbundene Augen und fünf Beine mit klauenartigen Manipulatoren. Ihr insektenähnlicher Rückenpanzer scheint nicht zu ihrer ursprünglichen Physiognomie zu gehören und legt den Schluss nahe, dass es sich bei den Shivanern um eine kybernetische Verbindung aus Biologie und Technologie handelt. Auch ihre integrierte Plasmawaffe deutet auf eine organisch-künstliche Fusion hin. Die Waffe könnte eine Art Focussiergerät sein, das von dem Wesen selbst angetrieben wird, auch wenn diese Vermutung noch Gegenstand einer hitzigen Kontroverse ist.

Diese wenigen Details belegen, dass die Shivaner sich nicht so entwickelt haben können wie die terranische oder vasudanische Spezies, sondern dass sie mit einiger Wahrscheinlichkeit von einer anderen Lebensform entwickelt wurden. Nur eine Handvoll Shivaner konnte jemals gefangengenommen werden, und alle Forschungen an lebenden Spezies endeten mit der Hades-Rebellion im Jahre 2335. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studien sind nach wie vor streng geheim.

Auch wenn die Shivaner offenkundig xenocidale, also fremdgesteuerte, Wesen sind, müssen ihre Motive und Ursprünge erst noch bestimmt werden. Alten Artefakten nach zu urteilen besitzen die Shivaner offenkundig eine Art Gefühl für Störungen innerhalb des Subraums. Wir wissen nicht, ob die Shivaner zufällig in diese Ecke der Galaxis geraten sind oder ob dies aufgrund eines Zyklus oder Musters geschah. Vielleicht haben sie ja auch die terranisch-vasudanischen Bewegungen im Subraum geortet. 

Xenobiologen wissen nur wenig über die shivanische Gesellschaft. Eine verbreitete Hypothese ist die Bienenkorb-Theorie, wonach die shivanische Gesellschaft in spezialisierte Funktionen unterteilt ist, die von einer Art kollektivem Bewusstsein gesteuert werden. Der bisher überzeugendste Beweis dieser Annahme ist das Verhalten shivanischer Truppen bei der Zerstörung der Lucifer, dem Wendepunkt des Grossen Krieges."

3200, "Die Uralten"

3201, "Während des Grossen Krieges, als die Vernichtung der Erde unausweichlich schien, entdeckten vasudanische Wissenschaftler die Überreste einer ausgestorbenen Zivilisation, die wir heute 'die Uralten' nennen. Mit Hilfe der ausgegrabenen Daten gelang es den Alliierten, die SD Lucifer in den Subraum zu verfolgen und zu zerstören.

Nach dem Grossen Krieg entdeckten Forscher noch mehrere solcher Siedlungen im gesamten terranisch-vasudanischen Raum. Obwohl nur Fragmente übriggeblieben sind, steht doch fest, dass diese interstellare Gesellschaft vor mehreren tausend Jahren existiert haben muss. Ihr Reich ging über die heutigen Grenzen des bekannten Raums hinaus, und die Archäologen hoffen, eine Karte der alten Sprungknoten zu finden, die es der Allianz ermöglichen könnte, in Systeme vorzudringen, die bisher noch nicht kartographiert werden konnten. 

Es existiert keine sichtbare Aufzeichnung dieser Zivilisation, von einigen hieroglyphischen Formen auf den Ruinen und einer Handvoll technologischer Schemata einmal abgesehen. Umfangreiche Ausgrabungen finden derzeit in Altair, Aldebaran und Deneb statt, aber die dort zusammengetragenen Daten sind nach wie vor streng geheim. 

Terranische Archäologen verwenden eine minoische Namenskonvention, um die Ruinen und grösseren Artefakte zu identifizieren. Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass die Shivaner vor etwa 8000 Jahren diese Zivilisation ausgelöscht haben. Die Uralten hielten die Shivaner für eine Rasse kosmischer Zerstörer und begriffen ihren eigenen Untergang als Vergeltungsakt dafür, dass sie ihren Platz in der vorbestimmten kosmischen Ordnung mutwillig verlassen hatten."

3202, "Der Subraum"

3203, "Mit einfachen Worten ausgedrückt ist der Subraum ein n-dimensionaler Tunnel zwischen zwei verschiedenen Punkten im Universum. Ein Raumschiff kann diesen Tunnel in wenigen Minuten durchqueren und sich somit eine Reise ersparen, die bei normaler Lichtgeschwindigkeit unter Umständen Jahrzehnte oder Jahrhunderte gedauert hätte.

Der Sprungantrieb verursacht am Raumschiff starke Vibrationen in mehrere Dimensionen, bis es sich in perfekter Übereinstimmung mit dem Subraum-Kontinuum befindet. Ein Wirbel tut sich auf und erzeugt die Öffnung eines unendlich kleinen Punkts im Kosmos, die es dem Raumschiff ermöglicht, die Schwelle zum Subraum zu überqueren. 

Zwei verschiedene Sprungarten sind möglich. 

Da gibt es zunächst den Intrasystem-Sprung zwischen zwei Punkten eines Sternensystems. Die meist kleinen Raumschiffe sind mit Motivatoren ausgerüstet, die zu solchen Sprüngen in der Lage sind. Weiterhin ist ein starkes Gravitationsfeld nötig, um Sprünge über die Grenzen eines Sternensystems hinaus zu verhindern.

Über Sprungknoten sind auch Sprünge von System zu System möglich. Bis zum Grossen Krieg waren nur die grösseren Raumschiffe in der Lage, die für Sprungknoten nötige Energiemenge zu erzeugen. Die Entwicklung des Sprungantriebs für Jäger und Bomber im Jahre 2335 erlaubte es der Allianz, die SD Lucifer zu zerstören. Die Produktion eines Sprungantriebs ist sündhaft teuer, also bleibt er auf Einsätze beschränkt, in denen die Reise zwischen den Systemen unbedingt nötig ist. Im Head-Up-Display wird die Existenz eines Sprungknotens mit einer grünen Umrandung angezeigt.

Die überwiegende Mehrheit dieser Subraum-Sprungknoten ist extrem instabil. Sprungknoten können ihre Formen innerhalb von Nanosekunden verändern oder sich ganz auflösen. Andere Knoten verfügen über eine höhere Lebenserwartung und bestehen jahrhundertelang, bevor sie kollabieren. Von der GTVA für den interstellaren Verkehr freigegebene Sprungknoten bleiben jedoch auf Jahre hinaus stabil."

Mit ihrem verbesserten Feuerleitsystem und den optimierten Lenkcomputern lässt sich die Tornado schneller und genauer abfeuern als die Hornet. Obwohl er kleiner ist als sein Vorgänger, feuert der Tornado-Werfer mehr Raketensalven ab und erzielt somit eine grössere Zerstörungskraft. Bitte denken Sie daran, dass die Sprengladung der Tornado erst scharfgemacht wird, wenn ein Ziel erfasst und fest aufgeschaltet ist."

3344, "Die GTM-19 Harpoon ist die technisch wohl ausgeklügeltste Waffe im GTVA-Arsenal. Sie ist nicht nur die schnellste zielsuchende Rakete der gesamten Flotte, sondern kann aufgrund der fortschrittlichen Fuzzy-Logic-Technologie ihr Ziel auch weitaus schneller aufschalten als jede andere Rakete ihrer Klasse. Der Sprengkopf steckt in einer Kapsel aus verbrauchtem ultradichten Uran, was ihm eine grösstmögliche Durchschlagskraft verschafft, bevor er tief im Rumpf des Ziels detoniert."

3356, "Die TAG-A Rakete entstand im Rahmen der streng geheimen GTVN-Forschungsprojekte zur Stealth-Technologie. Produziert und in Dienst gestellt wurde die Rakete schon kurze Zeit später, um möglichst rasch auf die sensorenzerstörenden Effekte des unlängst entdeckten Knossos-Nebels reagieren zu können. Beim Aufprall auf eine harte Oberfläche bleibt die Rakete dort 'kleben' und aktiviert ein kleines, kurzlebiges elektronisches Leuchtfeuer. Dieses Leuchtfeuer wird von einer winzigen Brennstoffzelle angetrieben, die eine Nutzungsdauer von mehreren Sekunden besitzt. In dieser Zeit sendet sie Lage- und Zielinformationen an alle Schiffe, die sich in Reichweite befinden."

3360, "Die TAG-B ist eine verbesserte Version der TAG-A-Standardrakete und stammt ebenfalls aus den Laboren des GTVN. Die ausgeklügelte elektronische Ausrüstung der TAG-B ist von einer stossresistenten Substruktur umgeben, um noch genauere Zielinformationen sammeln und an alle alliierte Truppen weitergeben zu können. Um diese verbesserte Zieltechnologie besser zu nutzen, ist eine generelle Umrüstung der Geschütztürme von GTVA-Schiffen geplant."

3364, "Die TAG-C ist die dritte und letzte Generation der TAG-Raketenfamilie aus den GaTeG-Labors. Dieses Modell bietet grössere Zuverlässigkeit und Kompatibilität mit der vorhandenen GTA-Geschützturmhardware. Die Markierung eines Ziels durch eine TAG-C führt zu einem verheerenden Trommelfeuer alliierter Artillerie. Deshalb bleibt der Einsatz der TAG-C ausschliesslich speziellen Elitegeschwadern vorbehalten."

3367, "GTM-10 Piranha"

3368, "Die GTM-10 Piranha ist die dritte Generation der alten Synaptic- und Havoc-Raketen und entfaltet einen hochexplosiven Jäger-Abwehrschirm. Die Piranha wird ferngezündet, indem der Pilot den Sekundärwaffen-Feuerknopf ein zweites Mal betätigt. Dadurch werden mehr als ein Dutzend hitzesuchender Mini-Raketen abgefeuert, die alle feindlichen Schiffe innerhalb ihrer Reichweite angreifen. Diese Funktionsweise macht die Piranha zu einer effektiven Waffe gegen feindliche Staffeln, die sich in geschlossener Formation nähern. Die Piranha ist mittlerweile Standardausrüstung für Bomber, deren Angriffziele massiv durch Jäger geschützt sind."

Bei der Detonation zerlegt sich die Infyrno in Dutzende von Schrappnells, von denen jedes einzelne wiederum eine hochexplosive Sprengladung enthält. Die Infyrno wird ferngezündet, indem der Pilot den Sekundärwaffen-Feuerknopf ein zweites Mal betätigt. Eine Anzeige im HUD meldet die jeweilige Entfernung der Rakete zum Schiff. Löst der Pilot die Detonation allerdings zu früh aus, riskiert er, selbst in den ausgedehnten Sprengradius der Infyrno zu geraten."

Sie gehört zu den Standard-Sekundärwaffen mit extrem hoher Abwurfgeschwindigkeit und ist mit den neuesten zielsuchenden Lenktechnologien ausgerüstet. In der gesamten Flotte gibt es keine vergleichbare Waffe, die derart konsequent weiterentwickelt worden wäre wie die Cyclops. Auch wenn die Entwicklung schon unmittelbar nach dem Ende des Grossen Krieges einsetzte, gehört sie aufgrund ihrer hervorragenden Eigenschaften immer noch zu den Hauptangriffswaffen.

Bestückt mit dem wohl mächtigsten Sprengkopf des gesamten Arsenals erzeugt der Helios eine massive Schockwelle, indem Materie und Antimaterie aufeinandertreffen, sobald sie auf ihr Ziel trifft. Eine Lafette mit Helios-Sprengköpfen kann nur alle 30 Sekunden einmal abgefeuert werden. Aufgrund der exorbitant hohen Produktionskosten ist der Einsatz des Helios streng reglementiert."

Nach einem Treffer sind die betroffenen Schiffe nicht mehr in der Lage, Ziele zu verfolgen, zu kommunizieren oder Zielerfassungsraketen aufzuschalten. Taktisch gesehen ist der GTM-14 eine äusserst effektive Bomberabwehr-Waffe, weil er zeitweilig auch die Lenk- und Antriebssysteme von im Anflug befindlichen Sprengköpfen lahmlegt. Diese verbesserte Version der EM-Impuls-Rakete dringt tiefer in die Kreisläufe der Subsysteme ein, was die Dauer der Unterbrechung nachhaltig erhöht."

Für alle Raumschlachten geeignet - defensiv und offensiv einzusetzen - mittlere Sprengkraft (16,5 Kilotonnen) - Infrarot-Zielverfolgung, halbintelligente Zielerfassung: Der Pilot wählt das Ziel aus, die MX-50 verfolgt es nach der Hitzesignatur des Antriebs, der Waffen und des Cockpits. Eine MX-50 greift immer ein Ziel an, das von den Bordcomputern der GTA-Kampfschiffe als feindlich eingestuft wird. Das garantiert eine höhere Abschussquote, wenn der Pilot mal in einem hitzigen Gefecht keine Zeit hat, sauber zu zielen.

Frühere Experimente mit Energieschutzschirmen wie den Deflektorschirmen auf Ross 128 haben ergeben, dass diese Waffe äusserst schwach ist gegen alles ausser stahlgepanzerten Zielen."

                                  FreeSpace 2: Das Launcher-Menü
                                 ---------------------------------------------------------

Mit Hilfe des Launcher-Menüs können Sie FreeSpace 2
starten und an Ihre Hardware anpassen können, neue
Versionen des Spiels herunterladen und die FreeSpace 2
Homepages im World Wide Web aufrufen. Hier eine kurze
Beschreibung für jeden Auswahlpunkt:


SPIELEN
  Startet das Spiel FreeSpace 2


SETUP
  Öffnet den Setup-Dialog, der wiederum in Grafik, Audio, Joystick,
Geschwindigkeit, Netzwerk, DirectX und Sonstiges eingeteilt ist.
"

3404, "
  * Grafik - Sie müssen eine 3D-Grafikkarte besitzen, um FreeSpace 2
spielen zu können. Sie können das Spiel nach Glide- und Direct3D-
kompatiblen Karten suchen lassen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im Interlaced-Modus abspielen' - Hierbei werden die
Bilder in zwei Durchgängen gezeichnet, damit langsamere Grafikkarten
damit zurechtkommen.
     - 'Filmsequenzen im FastClear-Modus abspielen' - Durch FastClear
werden die Einzelbilder der Animationen direkt aufeinandergezeichnet,
ohne dazwischen den Bildschirm zu löschen. Das kann auf manchen Karten
einige Flackereffekte verhindern.
     - 'Niedrige Direct3D-Texturdetails' beschleunigt das Spiel, indem
weniger Texturdetails verwendet werden, was natürlich dann in einer
schlechteren Grafik resultiert. Deswegen sollten Sie diese Option nur
dann aktivieren, wenn Sie während das Spiel oft stockt oder langsam
läuft.
     - 'WFOG erzwingen' - WFOG, eine Direct3D-Option, ist eine alter-
native Art, Nebeleffekte anzuzeigen (durch feste Tabellen statt
mit Vektorangaben). Manche Karten unterstützen WFOG nicht korrekt 
(z.B. die S4-Karte), deswegen ist die Option normalerweise deaktiviert.
Sie können aber gerne damit experimentieren.
     - 'Direct3D ZBuffer Bias deaktivieren' - Wenn Sie Direct3D
verwenden und Probleme beim Rendern der Geschwader-Logos sehen (die 
Logos überdecken alles andere), sollte diese Option den Fehler beheben.
"

3405, "
  * Audio - FreeSpace 2 unterstützt DirectSound, A3D und EAX. Sie können
einen dieser Standards auswählen, nachdem Sie auf 'Verfügbare Soundkarten
suchen' klicken und dann die gewünschte Soundkarte in der Liste
aussuchen. Ausserdem können Sie die Soundeffekte des Launchers hier ein-
und ausschalten.

  * Joystick - Hier können Sie Ihren Joystick für FreeSpace 2 einstellen.
Wenn Ihr Joystick Force Feedback unterstützt, kompatibel zu DirectX 6.0,
können Sie diese Option hier aktivieren.

  * Geschwindigkeit - Hier stellen Sie die Detailoptionen
für neue Piloten ein. Wir möchten darauf hinweisen, dass die 
Spielgeschwindigkeit deutlich beeinträchtigt werden kann, wenn Sie
diese Option höher als empfohlen setzen.

  * Netzwerk - Hier stellen Sie die Eigenschaften Ihrer Netzwerkhardware
ein, wie Geschwindigkeit und Art der Internetverbindung (falls
vorhanden). Sie können ausserdem hier Ihr PXO-Login eingeben, falls Sie 
sich bei diesem Internetservice eingetragen haben, oder einen
anderen Port erzwingen (Standard: 7808). Die 'PXO Banner' beziehen sich
auf den PXO-Chatscreen und zeigen, wenn aktiviert, Banner von guten
FreeSpace 2-Webseiten an.

  * DirectX - Hier wird Ihre DirectX-Version getestet. Es wird Ihnen
auch die Möglichkeit geboten, von hier aus DirectX zu installieren oder
zu aktualisieren.

  * Sonstiges - Hier können Sie sich noch die Sprache für das Spiel 
aussuchen. Einen Überblick über die möglichen Startparameter, die Sie 
in der Befehlszeile eingeben können, finden Sie in der README.TXT-Datei.
